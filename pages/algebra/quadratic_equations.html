				</div>

				<div class="plain_text">
					To begin with, the word quadratic comes from the latin word 'quadratum' - meaning square.
				</div> 

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="plain_text">
						Algebraic equations of the type \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) are called quadratic equations.
					</div> 
				</div>

				<div class="plain_text">
					They are characterized by having at least one variable raised to the power of 2. If the equation contains a power higher than 2, it is no longer a quadratic. In addition, quadratic equations are univariate, meaning that they do not contain more than one unknown variable. (It should be noted that homogenous quadratics are a special exception to this and can contain up to two unkowns). The following equations are all quadratics: 
					\[3x^2 = 6\] \[x^2 + 20x = 5\] \[5y^2 + 4y + 25 = 0\]
					Often times, these equations are called 'second degree polynomials'. The term polynomial itself is much broader, and even the term 'second degree polynomial' is still too broad to solely represent quadratics.
				</div>

				<div class="section_box">
					<practicality class="section_heading">An Overview Of The Practicality Of Quadratics</practicality>
				</div>

				<div class="plain_text">
					Quadratic equations are often regarded as a fundamental concept in mathematics, although their exact significance may be subject to debate. However, it is important to establish their utility to the average person, irrespective of general perceptions. To this end, understanding the graph of a quadratic function is essential. Quadratic functions generate symmetrical, U-shaped curves known as parabolas. The direction of the parabola, either opening upward or downward, depends on the coefficients of the quadratic function.
				</div>

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="slide_text">
						The general form of a quadratic function is \[f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\] where a, b, and c are constants. The coefficient "a" determines the shape of the parabola. If a is positive, the parabola opens upwards, and if a is negative, the parabola opens downwards. The constant "b" affects the position of the vertex of the parabola, and the constant "c" determines the y-intercept of the parabola. In the graph of \(y = x^2 \) shown on the side, the coefficient a = 1, the constant b = 0, and c = 0. Consequently, the vertex occurs at (0, 0) and the y intercept is also 0. We can also note that the graph opens upward, as 'a' is positive.

				<div class="plain_text">
					Quadratic equations and their parabolic graphs are significant in the real world, providing a practical framework for solving problems that involve complex data. Before applying quadratic models to real-world problems, it is important to analyze the relevant data carefully, such as financial information for a startup business, physical phenomena like gravity, or the impact of globalization on the economy. It is crucial to determine if there is a precedent for a 'quadratic fit' to avoid inaccurate solutions. For example, the parabolic motion of a ball thrown across a field can be modeled by a quadratic equation. However, a mathematical model for the stock of a large tech company like Google would require a different approach. The knowledge that projectile motion is typically parabolic in the real world can help us use a mathematical model based on a quadratic equation to solve problems related to projectiles, from launching a nuclear missile in the real world to computing the path of a bullet in a video game. Thus, understanding the quadratic equation can help us model and solve problems related to these issues.
					<br>
					<br>
					In truth, simple everyday problems that require an understanding of quadratic equations are relatively rare. However, the practical value of the quadratic equation lies in its ability to serve as a fundamental tool for comprehending a broad range of other mathematical problems. By providing a foundation for understanding the underlying principles and relationships of many mathematical concepts, the quadratic equation can effectively serve as a pathway to more advanced topics. Its scope extends beyond its immediate application as a math problem, making it an essential component of mathematical education and problem-solving.

				<div class="plain_text">
					There are various methods to find the roots of a quadratic equation, such as factoring, completing the square, and using the quadratic formula. In this discussion, I will focus solely on the quadratic formula. However, it's worth noting that each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. While I won't delve into the other two approaches in this conversation, I believe it's essential to provide a justification for my decision, as it can shed light on how quadratics are utilized in practical applications.
				</div>

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="plain_text">
						The problem with factoring quadratic equations is that real-world problems usually involve more complex equations that cannot be easily solved through this method. Factoring is often taught as a means to learn the process itself rather than to highlight the practical applications of quadratic equations.
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="plain_text">
						Completing the square is a more powerful technique than factoring, but it is closely related to the quadratic formula. In fact, the quadratic formula is derived from completing the square, and we will explore this derivation in depth later on. However, when it comes to practical applications, the quadratic formula is typically the more convenient option. This is because it is widely recognized and easily implemented in programming and other relevant software. 
					</div>

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="plain_text">
						The bottom line is, that I have at hand, three unique methods that produce the same solution. Since none of these solutions will yield a different answer than the other, I have personally found it the most sensible to utilize the one that is objectively the most practical - the Quadratic Formula.

					<derivation class="sub_heading">A Quick Review Of Completing The Square</derivation>
				</div>


				<div class="plain_text">
					Unlike factoring, which can only be performed on quadratic equations that are 'perfect squares', completing the square involves forcefully manipulating the varibles for any given quadratic equation, so that it necessarily becomes a perfect square. When we apply this technique to the standard form of the quadratic equation ( \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) ), the result is the quadratic formula. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Since completing the sqaure is significant to understanding the derivation of the quadratic formula, I will begin with an example of completing the square for a simple quadratic, that will take us through the underlying thought process that goes into the quadratic formula.
				</div>

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="plain_text">
						Consider the following Quadratic Equation: \[x^2 - 3x - {4 \over 5} = 0 \]

						In completeing the square, my goal is to make this a perfect square.

						Essentially I would like to arrive at:
						\[x^2 - 3x - {4 \over 5} = (x - a)^2 \]

						Here \( (x - a)^2 \) represents the binomial that we commonly arive at when solving for the roots of a quadratic equation.
						<br>
						<br>
						If we expand that binomial we get \(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 \) , which implies:
						\[x^2 + 2ax + a^2 = (x - a)^2 \]
						How is this relevant to the quadratic we want to solve? Well, this equation can be considered an 'identity' that we can now begin to model our original equation around, to create a perfect square.
						<br>
						<br>
						We can begin by rewriting the equation as follows:
						\[x^2 -3x = {4 \over 5} \]
						Looking back at our identity - \(x^2 + 2ax + a^2\) , in beginning to model our quadratic to this equation we can easily identify that 
						\[2a = -3\]
						Hence: 
						\[a = {-3 \over 2} \ and \ a^2 = {9 \over 4} \]
						Adding \(a^2\) into our equation, we get:
						\[x^2 -3x + {9 \over 4} = {4 \over 5} + {9 \over 4} \]
						\[x^2 -3x + {9 \over 4} = {61 \over 20} \]
						So by design we are now left with a quadratic that is a perfect square \(x^2 -3x + {9 \over 4} \). If you examine the equation you will notice that:
						\[{-3 \over 2} * {-3 \over 2} = {9 \over 4} \]
						and 
						\[{-3 \over 2} + {-3 \over 2} = -3\]
						(Remember this is by design)
						Hence we have:
						\[(x - {3 \over 2})^2 = {61 \over 20} \]
						Taking the root of both sides gives us:
						\[x - {3 \over 2} = \pm \sqrt{{61 \over 20}} \]
						Hence:
						\[x = {3 \over 2} \pm \sqrt{{61 \over 20}} \]
						Thus, 
						\[x = 3.25 \ and \ x = -0.25 \]

				<div class="sub_box">
					<derivation class="sub_heading">Deriving The Quadratic Formula</derivation>
				</div>

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="plain_text">
						As stated earlier, deriving the quadratic formula is the same as completing the square on the standard form of the quadratic function, i.e.
						\[ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \]

						To utilize our identity \(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 = (x - a^2) \) we can rearrange the equation a bit:
						\[ax^2 + bx = -c \]

						Dividing both sides by the coefficent 'a', we get:
						\[x^2 + {b \over a}(x) = {-c \over a} \]

						Using our identity, 
						\[2a = {b \over a} \]
						\[a = {b \over 2a} \]
						\[a^2 = ({b \over 2a})^2 \]

						To recreate our identity, we need to add this \(a^2\) value to the equation. The result is:
						\[x^2 + {b \over a}(x) + ({b \over 2a})^2 = {-c \over a} + ({b \over 2a})^2 \]
						\[(x + {b \over 2a})^2 =  {-c \over a} + {b^2 \over 4a^2} \]
						\[(x + {b \over 2a})^2 = {-4ac \over 4a^2} + {b^2 \over 4a^2} \]
						\[(x + {b \over 2a})^2 = {b^2 - 4ac \over 4a^2} \]
						Taking the root of both sides:
						\[x + {b \over 2a} = {\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 4a} \]
						\[x = {\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 4a} - {b \over 2a} \]
						Thus we arrive at the quadratic formula:
						\[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a} \]
