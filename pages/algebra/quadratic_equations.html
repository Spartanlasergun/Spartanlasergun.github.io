				<div class="plain_text">
					To begin with, the word quadratic comes from the latin word 'quadratum' - meaning square. \[Algebraic \ equations \ of \ the \ type \ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \ are \ called \ quadratic \ equations \] They are characterized by having at least one variable raised to the power of 2. If the equation contains a power higher than 2, it is no longer a quadratic. In addition, quadratic equations are univariate, meaning that they do not contain more than one unknown variable. (It should be noted that homogenous quadratics are a special exception to this and can contain up to two unkowns). The following equations are all quadratics: 
					\[3x^2 = 6\] \[x^2 + 20x = 5\] \[5y^2 + 4y + 25 = 0\]
					Often times, these equations are called 'second degree polynomials'. The term polynomial itself is much broader, and even the term 'second degree polynomial' is still too broad to solely represent quadratics.

				<div class="plain_text">
					Quadratic equations are often regarded as a fundamental concept in mathematics, although their exact significance may be subject to debate. However, it is important to establish their utility to the average person, irrespective of general perceptions. To this end, understanding the graph of a quadratic function is essential. Quadratic functions generate symmetrical, U-shaped curves known as parabolas. The direction of the parabola, either opening upward or downward, depends on the coefficients of the quadratic function.

						The general form of a quadratic function is \[f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\] where a, b, and c are constants. The coefficient "a" determines the shape of the parabola. If a is positive, the parabola opens upwards, and if a is negative, the parabola opens downwards. The constant "b" affects the position of the vertex of the parabola, and the constant "c" determines the y-intercept of the parabola. In the graph of \(y = x^2 \) shown on the side, the coefficient a = 1, the constant b = 0, and c = 0. Consequently, the vertex occurs at (0, 0) and the y intercept is also 0. We can also note that the graph opens upward, as 'a' is positive.

					Quadratic equations and their parabolic graphs are significant in the real world, providing a practical framework for solving problems that involve complex data. Before applying quadratic models to real-world problems, it is important to analyze the relevant data carefully, such as financial information for a startup business, physical phenomena like gravity, or the impact of globalization on the economy. It is crucial to determine if there is a precedent for a 'quadratic fit' to avoid inaccurate solutions. For example, the parabolic motion of a ball thrown across a field can be modeled by a quadratic equation. However, a mathematical model for the stock of a large tech company like Google would require a different approach. The knowledge that projectile motion is typically parabolic in the real world can help us use a mathematical model based on a quadratic equation to solve problems related to projectiles, from launching a nuclear missile in the real world to computing the path of a bullet in a video game. Thus, understanding the quadratic equation can help us model and solve problems related to these issues.

					In truth, simple everyday problems that require an understanding of quadratic equations are relatively rare. However, the practical value of the quadratic equation lies in its ability to serve as a fundamental tool for comprehending a broad range of other mathematical problems. By providing a foundation for understanding the underlying principles and relationships of many mathematical concepts, the quadratic equation can effectively serve as a pathway to more advanced topics. Its scope extends beyond its immediate application as a math problem, making it an essential component of mathematical education and problem-solving.

                	When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
