				</div>

				<div class="plain_text">
					To begin with, the word quadratic comes from the latin word 'quadratum' - meaning square.
				</div> 

				<div class="bullets">
					<div class="plain_text">
						Algebraic equations of the type \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) are called quadratic equations.
					</div> 
				</div>

				<div class="plain_text">
					They are characterized by having at least one variable raised to the power of 2. If the equation contains a power higher than 2, it is no longer a quadratic. In addition, quadratic equations are univariate, meaning that they do not contain more than one unknown variable. (It should be noted that homogenous quadratics are a special exception to this and can contain up to two unkowns). The following equations are all quadratics: 
					\[3x^2 = 6\] \[x^2 + 20x = 5\] \[5y^2 + 4y + 25 = 0\]
					Often times, these equations are called 'second degree polynomials'. The term polynomial itself is much broader, and even the term 'second degree polynomial' is still too broad to solely represent quadratics.

				<div class="plain_text">
					Quadratic equations are often regarded as a fundamental concept in mathematics, although their exact significance may be subject to debate. However, it is important to establish their utility to the average person, irrespective of general perceptions. To this end, understanding the graph of a quadratic function is essential. Quadratic functions generate symmetrical, U-shaped curves known as parabolas. The direction of the parabola, either opening upward or downward, depends on the coefficients of the quadratic function.
				</div>

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="slide_text">
						The general form of a quadratic function is \[f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\] where a, b, and c are constants. The coefficient "a" determines the shape of the parabola. If a is positive, the parabola opens upwards, and if a is negative, the parabola opens downwards. The constant "b" affects the position of the vertex of the parabola, and the constant "c" determines the y-intercept of the parabola. In the graph of \(y = x^2 \) shown on the side, the coefficient a = 1, the constant b = 0, and c = 0. Consequently, the vertex occurs at (0, 0) and the y intercept is also 0. We can also note that the graph opens upward, as 'a' is positive.

				<div class="plain_text">
					Quadratic equations and their parabolic graphs are significant in the real world, providing a practical framework for solving problems that involve complex data. Before applying quadratic models to real-world problems, it is important to analyze the relevant data carefully, such as financial information for a startup business, physical phenomena like gravity, or the impact of globalization on the economy. It is crucial to determine if there is a precedent for a 'quadratic fit' to avoid inaccurate solutions. For example, the parabolic motion of a ball thrown across a field can be modeled by a quadratic equation. However, a mathematical model for the stock of a large tech company like Google would require a different approach. The knowledge that projectile motion is typically parabolic in the real world can help us use a mathematical model based on a quadratic equation to solve problems related to projectiles, from launching a nuclear missile in the real world to computing the path of a bullet in a video game. Thus, understanding the quadratic equation can help us model and solve problems related to these issues.

					In truth, simple everyday problems that require an understanding of quadratic equations are relatively rare. However, the practical value of the quadratic equation lies in its ability to serve as a fundamental tool for comprehending a broad range of other mathematical problems. By providing a foundation for understanding the underlying principles and relationships of many mathematical concepts, the quadratic equation can effectively serve as a pathway to more advanced topics. Its scope extends beyond its immediate application as a math problem, making it an essential component of mathematical education and problem-solving.

						Solving a quadratic equation by factoring involves finding two binomials that, when multiplied, give the quadratic expression. The roots of the quadratic equation are then found by setting each binomial equal to zero and solving for the variable. Here's a step-by-step process for solving a quadratic equation by factoring:
					</div>

				<div class="steps">

					<div class="step_box">
						Rewrite the quadratic equation in standard form. A quadratic equation is in standard form when it is written as \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) where a, b, and c are constants and x is the variable.
					</div>

					<div class="bullets">

						<div class="step_box">
							The general strategy for factoring a quadratic equation is as follows:
						</div>

						<div class="step_box">
							1) If the coefficient of the \(x^2\) term is not 1, factor out the GCF (greatest common factor) of all the terms first.
						</div>

						<div class="step_box">
							2) Look for two numbers that multiply to the constant term (c) and add up to the coefficient of the x-term (b). These are the two numbers that you will use as the coefficients of the linear terms in the binomials.
						</div>

						<div class="step_box">
							3) Use these two numbers to write the two binomials. The first term of each binomial should be x, and the second term should be the number you found in step 2.
						</div>

						<div class="step_box">
							4) Check your answer by multiplying the two binomials together. The result should be the original quadratic equation.
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="steps">
					<div class="step_box">
						Set each binomial equal to zero. This gives you two equations, each of which represents a possible root of the quadratic equation.
					</div>

					<div class="step_box">
						Solve each equation for the variable. This gives you the two roots of the quadratic equation.
					</div>
				</div>


				<div class="plain_text">
					Here is an example of solving a quadratic by factoring:
				</div>

				<div class="steps">
					<div class="step_box">
						Example: Solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 + 5x = -6\) by factoring.
					</div>

					<div class="bullets">
						<div class="step_box">
							Step 1: Rewrite the quadratic equation in standard form:
							\[x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0\]
						</div>

						<div class="step_box">
							Step 2: Factor the quadratic expression:
							<br>
							The numbers that add to 5, and multiply to give 6, are 2 & 3.
							Hence the resulting binomials are:
							\[(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0\]
						</div>

						<div class="step_box">
							Step 3: Set each binomial equal to zero:
							\[x + 2 = 0 \ or \ x + 3 = 0\]
						</div>

						<div class="step_box">
							Step 4: Solve each equation for the variable:
							\[x = -2 \ or \ x = -3 \]
						</div>

						<div class="step_box">
							The roots of the quadratic equation are \[x = -2 \ and \ x = -3 \]
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="plain_text">
					Note that not all quadratic equations can be factored, and sometimes factoring is not the most efficient method for finding the roots. In those cases, completing the square or using the quadratic formula may be necessary.
