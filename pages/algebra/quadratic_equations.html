				<div class="plain_text">
					To begin with, the word quadratic comes from the latin word 'quadratum' - meaning square. \[Algebraic \ equations \ of \ the \ type \ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \ are \ called \ quadratic \ equations \] They are characterized by having at least one variable raised to the power of 2. If the equation contains a power higher than 2, it is no longer a quadratic. In addition, quadratic equations are univariate, meaning that they do not contain more than one unknown variable. (It should be noted that their are special exceptions to this). The following equations are all quadratics: 
					\[3x^2 = 6\] \[x^2 + 20x = 5\] \[5y^2 + 4y + 25 = 0\]
					Often times, these equations are called 'second degree polynomials'. The term polynomial itself is much broader, and even the term 'second degree polynomial' is still too broad to solely represent quadratics.
					<br>
					<br>
					Quadratic equations are generally thought of as a foundational concept in mathematics. The reasoning behind this can be debated, but my primary concern is in verifying and establishing it's utlility to the reader regardless of what is generally understood. To this end it is essential that we understand the graph of a quadratic. All quadratic functions produce curves known as parabolas. A parabola is a symmetrical, U-shaped curve that can either open upwards or downwards, depending on the coefficients of the quadratic function.

						The general form of a quadratic function is \[f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\] where a, b, and c are constants. The coefficient "a" determines the shape of the parabola. If a is positive, the parabola opens upwards, and if a is negative, the parabola opens downwards. The constant "b" affects the position of the vertex of the parabola, and the constant "c" determines the y-intercept of the parabola. In the graph of \(y = x^2 \) shown on the side, the coefficient a = 1, the constant b = 0, and c = 0. Consequently, the vertex occurs at (0, 0) and the y intercept is also 0. We can also note that the graph opens upward, as 'a' is positive.

					Quadratic equations typically have multiple solutions, which can be found by using various methods, including factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. They arise naturally in many fields of mathematics and science, including algebra, geometry, physics, and engineering, and have numerous applications in real-life problems, such as finding the maximum or minimum of a function, modeling the motion of objects, or predicting the behavior of systems.

                	When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
                	\[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}\]
