					Logarithms were invented in 1614 by scottish mathematician John Napier as a way of simplifying calculations involving exponents. Logarithms are a fundamental mathematical concept used to solve a variety of problems involving exponential growth or decay, such as in science, engineering, and finance. They are essentially the inverse operation of exponentiation.

						Logarithms are a unique algebraic concept. In working with exponents, it is only natural that from time to time, special algebraic manipulation of exponents will become necessary. Consider the function:

						\[y = 2^x\]

						This is an interesting problem. What is the exact mathematical relationship between the variables \(y\) and \(x\)? Can we define \(x\) explicitly in terms of \(y\). If I told you that \(y = 10\), could you solve for \(x\), i.e.:

						\[10 = 2^x\]

						Using an exhaustive numerical technique, we can perhaps arrive at an answer:

						\[2^2 = 4\]
						\[2^3 = 8\]
						\[2^{3.1} = 8.5742\]
						\[2^{3.2} = 9.1895\]
						\[2^{3.3} = 9.8491\]
						\[2^{3.31} = 9.9177\]
						\[...\] 

						But of course, such a method is not very practical. Alternatively, we can graph the function easily enough and estimate corresponding values of \(y\) and \(x\) based on our graph.

						Lets take a look at the graph of the function for \(0 &le; x &le; 4\).
						<br><br>
						Using a graph we can estimate any value of \(x\) that we wanted. In this case, we see that when \(y = 10\), \(x = 3.32\). 
						<br><br>
						In cases where the base of the exponent is much larger, we are easily going run into problems in graphing the larger functions on paper; as in the case of:

						\[y = 10^x\]

						In 1614, Scottish mathematician John Napier would have encountered this very issue and consequently would have produced the very first set of logarithmic tables. These tables essentially would have been predetermined calculations relating variables of exponent functions similar to the form \(y = a^x\), that could easily be used to look-up the corresponding solutions for the variable exponent. These tables are called systems of logarithms.
						<br><br>
						In modern day mathematics, there is very little need to consult with such a table as most calculators are programmed with the necessary values. This brings us to the notation associated with logarithms. Consider the function:

						\[n = 10^x\]

						Let \(n\) be any positive number, and let \(x\) be its index to base 10.

						We can say that:

						\[x = index \ \ of \ \ power \ \ n \ \ to \ \ base \ \ 10\]

						Because this is cumbersome to write we simply say:

						\[x = \log_{10}n\]

						The number indicating the base is given as subscript. Hence, if \(e\) is the base we write

						\[x = \log_{e}n\]

						In this way we are able to represent \(x\) as a function of \(n\).
						<br><br>
						Logarithms of base 10 are the most commonly used in the field, and so most calculators default to calculations in base 10, hence
						
						\[\log_{10}x\]
						
						is assumed to be the same as

						\[\log(x)\]
