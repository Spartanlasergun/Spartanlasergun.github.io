						The conception of the soul is possibly the earliest known concept of psychological phenomena. In various philosophical and religious traditions, the soul is believed to be the essence of a person's being and the source of their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. This concept was central to the work of many early psychologists, including Plato and Aristotle, who explored the nature of the soul and its role in shaping human behavior. It was the most natural way of unifying concepts than were non-physical, and so resulted in the birth of an orthodox 'spiritualistic' theory that asserted the exisitence of non-physical entities.

						Here, I would endeavour to draw the reader's attention to a particular point of interest, as we no doubt will hit upon this issue as the most fundamental in the field. What I am refering to, is the idea of 'unifying' psychological phenomena around some central idea to which they would all have equal relevance - perhaps even in a philosophical way. As primitive as the idea of the soul is, it provided exactly this for anyone that attempted an understanding of the mind in humanity's early days.

						Following this, we have had many other ideas that played a part in shaping our modern understanding of the mind, including Associationism, Struturalism, Functionalism, Behaviorism, Gestalt Psychology and Psychoanalysis to name a few. Looking roughly at the last hundred years, the relevance of the Brain as it concerns its influence on all aspects of understanding and behaviour has also begun to play a significant part in our understanding of psychological phenomena. For the purposes of the information that is presented here, it will suffice to end this introduction without further elaboration on these ideas, as they are none too few.

						The following article will go through the timeline of the most important psychological ideas with a brief review of each. However, it should be noted that my general intentions with subsequent articles are to deal with psychological phenomena themselves and speak to the relevant frameworks and theories as the need arises. Narrowing the focus to any one framework would no doubt result in the neglect of potentially valid perspectives - and it is my goal in no small part, to avoid this problem.
