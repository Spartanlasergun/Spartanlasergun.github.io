					</div>
					<div class="content_left">
						The conception of the soul predates written history and so it is challenging to pinpoint an exact date for when the idea of the soul was first conceptualized. However, the idea itself can be considered as the first and most primitive attempt at understanding psychological phenomena. In ancient Egypt, the belief in an immortal soul called the "ka" was prominent as early as the Old Kingdom period (circa 2686-2181 BCE). Ancient Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle contemplated the nature of the soul around the 4th century BCE. Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and many indigenous belief systems also contributed to development of this idea which is still a part of all of these religious belief systems to this day.

						<div class="concept">Associationism</div>
						<div class="year">1689</div>
					</div>
					<div class="content_right">
						The phrase “association of ideas” was first used by John Locke in 1689 in Chapter 33 of An Essay Concerning Human Understanding entitled “Of the Association of Ideas″. At this point it time it was much more a philosophical type of understanding rather that a treatise on cognition or the functioning of the human mind. Many intellectuals over the years that followed embraced the idea including David Hume, David Hartley, Joseph Priestley, James Mill, John Stuart Mill, Alexander Bain, and Ivan Pavlov. It is considered to have influenced the development of several major psychological frameworks and concepts, but by itself, associationism never amounted to much more than an enticing philosophical perspective.

						<div class="concept">Structuralism</div>
					</div>
					<div class="content_left">
						William Wundt is credited as being the founder of struturalism which is one of the earliest schools of thought in psychology. Though Wundt is understood to be the founder, his student Edward B. Titchener was the one who invented the term 'structuralism', and published the first paper on the subject in 1898 - entitled, 'The Postulates of A Structural Psychology'. Titchener believed that the use of introspection, which utilized observers who had been rigorously trained to analyze their feelings and sensations when shown a simple stimulus, could be used to discover the structures of the mind. The use of this framework died out shortly after the passing of it's founder.

						<div class="concept">Nativism</div>
						<div class="year">1928</div>
					</div>
					<div class="content_right">
						Nativism much like Associationism has a bit of philosophical history that preculdes its relationship with psychology. After John Locke popularized the Associationist viewpoint, philosophers like Immanuel Kant gave criticism from the Nativist standpoint asserting that humans do have an innate understanding. However, the modern nativism that is much more aligned with a psychological understanding is most associated with the work of Jerry Fodor (1935–2017), Noam Chomsky (b. 1928), and Steven Pinker (b. 1954), who argue that humans from birth have certain cognitive modules (specialised genetically inherited psychological abilities) that allow them to learn and acquire certain skills, such as language.
