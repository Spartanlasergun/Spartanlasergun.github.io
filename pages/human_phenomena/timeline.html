						<div class="concept"> The Soul</div>
					</div>
					<div class="content_left">
						The conception of the soul predates written history and so it is challenging to pinpoint an exact date for when the idea of the soul was first conceptualized. However, the idea itself can be considered as the first and most primitive attempt at understanding psychological phenomena. In ancient Egypt, the belief in an immortal soul called the "ka" was prominent as early as the Old Kingdom period (circa 2686-2181 BCE). Ancient Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle contemplated the nature of the soul around the 4th century BCE. Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and many indigenous belief systems also contributed to development of this idea which is still a part of all of these religious belief systems to this day.

						<div class="concept">Associationism</div>
						<div class="year">1689</div>
					</div>
					<div class="content_right">
						The phrase “association of ideas” was first used by John Locke in 1689 in Chapter 33 of An Essay Concerning Human Understanding entitled “Of the Association of Ideas″. At this point it time it was much more a philosophical type of understanding rather that a treatise on cognition or the functioning of the human mind. Many intellectuals over the years that followed embraced the idea including David Hume, David Hartley, Joseph Priestley, James Mill, John Stuart Mill, Alexander Bain, and Ivan Pavlov. It is considered to have influenced the development of several major psychological frameworks and concepts, but by itself, associationism never amounted to much more than an enticing philosophical perspective.

						<div class="concept">Functionalism</div>
						<div class="year">1890</div>
					</div>
					<div class="content_left">
						Functionalism is a theoretical framework that originated in psychology and later expanded into other disciplines such as sociology and anthropology. It emerged as a response to the shortcomings the structuralist viewpoint which had not yet taken firm roots in academia. Functionalism, sought to understand the purpose or function of mental processes and behavior. William James is credited as the founder of functionalism for his seminal work "The Principles of Psychology" published in 1890. In sociology, functionalism emerged as a prominent theoretical perspective through the works of sociologists such as Émile Durkheim, Talcott Parsons, and Robert Merton.

						<div class="concept">Psychoanalysis</div>
						<div class="year">1895</div>
					</div>
					<div class="content_right">
						The origins of psychoanalysis can be traced back to the work of Sigmund Freud, an Austrian neurologist and psychiatrist. The first significant paper on psychoanalysis (published in 1895) was entitled "Studies on Hysteria". It was a collaborative work between Sigmund Freud and his colleague Josef Breuer. Freud and Breuer presented their ideas on the origins and treatment of hysteria and introduced concepts such as the unconscious mind, repression, and the cathartic method of therapy. Later on, techniques like free association and dream analysis, psychoanalysis sought to bring these unconscious processes to light, providing insights into mental disorders, human development, and the complexities of human nature.

						<div class="year">1898</div>
						<div class="concept">Structuralism</div>
					</div>
					<div class="content_left">
						William Wundt is credited as being the founder of struturalism which is one of the earliest schools of thought in psychology. Though Wundt is understood to be the founder, his student Edward B. Titchener was the one who invented the term 'structuralism', and published the first paper on the subject in 1898 - entitled, 'The Postulates of A Structural Psychology'. Titchener believed that the use of introspection, which utilized observers who had been rigorously trained to analyze their feelings and sensations when shown a simple stimulus, could be used to discover the structures of the mind. The use of this framework died out shortly after the passing of it's founder.

						<div class="concept">Gestalt Psychology</div>
						<div class="year">1912</div>
					</div>
					<div class="content_right">
						Gestalt psychology was developed in the early 20th century by a group of German psychologists, primarily Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Köhler, and Kurt Koffka. The term "gestalt" comes from the German word meaning "form" or "configuration," and the central idea of the theory is that the mind perceives and organizes sensory information into meaningful wholes or "gestalts" rather than isolated parts. Though Gestalt psychology never got far on its own, it did in fact lay some of the groundwork for cognitive psychology, and it's central philosophy - "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts" - has been a guiding force behind user interface design in computers.

						<div class="concept">Behaviourism</div>
						<div class="year">1913</div>
					</div>
					<div class="content_left">
						In 1913, John B. Watson (the founder of behaviourism) published an article titled "Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It," which laid the foundation for behaviorism as a distinct approach to understanding the mind. Behaviourism arose as a challenge to both Functionalsim and Structuralism which were subjective and introspective rather than empirical and scientific. Behaviourism as Watson viewed it, was concerned solely with observable behavior that could be studied objectively and experimentally, focusing on stimulus-response associations and the environmental factors that influence behavior.  B.F. Skinner expanded upon Watson's ideas and developed a branch of behaviorism known as operant conditioning.

						<div class="concept">Nativism</div>
						<div class="year">1923</div>
					</div>
					<div class="content_right">
						Nativism much like Associationism, has a bit of philosophical history that preculdes its relationship with psychology. After John Locke popularized the Associationist viewpoint, philosophers like Immanuel Kant gave criticism from the Nativist standpoint asserting that humans do have an innate understanding. Jean Piaget's "The Language and Thought of the Child" (1923) is one of the first papers that discusses this idea. The modern nativist perspective was furthered by many others including Jerry Fodor (1935–2017), Noam Chomsky (b. 1928), and Steven Pinker (b. 1954), who argue that humans from birth have certain cognitive modules that allow them to learn and acquire certain skills, such as language.

						<div class="concept">Cognitive Psychology</div>
						<div class="year">1967</div>
					</div>
					<div class="content_left">
						The father of cognitive psychology is generally considered to be Ulric Neisser. He played a pivotal role in establishing cognitive psychology as a distinct discipline in the late 1960s. Neisser's book, "Cognitive Psychology," published in 1967, is often credited with introducing the term "cognitive psychology" and outlining its foundational concepts and principles. His work emphasized the study of mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, and problem-solving, which laid the groundwork for the development of cognitive psychology as a major branch of psychology. Today, it is used in many different areas including: Computer UI Design, Education and even Cognitive Neuroscience.

					<div class="time_heading_right">
						<div class="concept">Ecological Systems Theory</div>
						<div class="year">1979</div>
					</div>
					<div class="content_right">
						The first paper on ecological systems theory, titled "The Ecology of Human Development: Experiments by Nature and Design," was published in 1979 by Urie Bronfenbrenner. This psychological framework examines human development within the context of various interconnected environmental systems; the microsystem, mesosystem, exosytem, macrosystem and chronosystem. Each of these systems represents the enrionment of an individual at different levels, starting with the closest relationships - immediate family - moving outward to society at large. It emphasizes the dynamic interactions between individuals and their environments, recognizing that development is influenced by multiple levels of systems.

						<div class="concept">Positive Psychology</div>
						<div class="year">1998</div>
					</div>
					<div class="content_left">
						Positive psychology was founded by Martin Seligman, an American psychologist and author. It is the branch of psychology that focuses on studying and promoting human well-being, happiness, and flourishing. Rather than solely focusing on addressing psychological disorders and problems, positive psychology aims to go beyond the "neutral zone" and explore what makes life worth living. It seeks to identify factors that contribute to individuals' happiness and life satisfaction and develop interventions to enhance these factors. The first paper on positive psychology was published in 1998. The paper, titled "Positive Psychology: An Introduction," was written by Martin Seligman and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.
