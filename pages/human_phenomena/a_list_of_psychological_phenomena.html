					There is an immesurable world of ideas that are linked to the human mind and by extension to psychology. As a consequence, there have been no real attempts to formulate a list of psychological phenomena as there is no emprical means of drawing boundaries for classification. Were anyone to attempt such an endeavour, they would simply have put together a list of ideas that they themselves have fancied as being part of the psychological realm. Even if it were possible to produce an empirical list, you would still be faced with the unanswerable question of "what exactly is this list to be used for?" It has ever been the practice of psychologists and those who study the mind to investigate psychological problems at their own disrection, and the means of data collection that facilitates this necessarily narrows the focus of the researcher to no more than a handful of issues that he can explore during his short lifetime. Ergo, a list of psychological phenomena would for decades have been seen as useless and biased to no small degree.
					<br>
					<br>
					At present, things have changed in way that gives tremendous value to a list of psychological phenomena - empirical or otherwise. The reasons are simple:
					<br>
					1) Improvements in communication - the internet - has made it possible to gather large amounts of data in very short periods of time.
					<br>
					2) The means of assessing this data is no longer an issue with the advent of better computers and advanced machine learning techniques.
					<br>
					As such, I have found it possible to suspend any trepidations that would hinder the creation of a list of psychological phenomena and have attempted to produce one that will facilitate my own research and understanding. In creating this list I have consulted with numerous resources inculding: 

					<div class="center_image" style="font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">
						APA Dictionary of Psychology
						<br><br>
						Gale Encylopedia of Psychology
					</div>

					Throughout the course of my research, patterns emerged that necessitated the implementation of rules for classification to prevent redundancy and unecessary overlap bewteen identified phenomena. This list of rules is given below with a brief explanation of their function.

						1) Must have a sole genesis within the human mind.
						<div class="slide_text" style="font-style:italic">
							To distinguish between immaterial constructs that may pose as being psychological in nature, identified phenomena must be able to be distguished as having originated within the human mind. For example: The sociological construct of 'Leadership' can be distinguished from the psychological phenomena that may constitute some part of its existence - dominance, sumbissiveness etc. - if we can consider the locus of its existence as beyond the human mind. 
						</div>
						<br>
						2) Must possess the qualities of both a state and a process.
						<br>
						3) Must not have a natural antithesis
						<div class="slide_text" style="font-style:italic">
							To avoid the redundant classification of concepts and ideas that may indirectly describe each other, psychological phenomena must not possess a natural antithesis. Example: The natural antithesis of dominance is sumbmissiveness, and an investigation into one will no doubt paint a picture of the other. However, the governing psychological phenomena is 'Personality' which does not possess a natural antithesis.
