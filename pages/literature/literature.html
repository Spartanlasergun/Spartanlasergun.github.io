					Edgar Allan Poe, born on January 19, 1809, in Boston, Massachusetts, was an American writer and poet whose works have had a profound and lasting impact on literature. Poe's life was marked by tragedy and hardship, which greatly influenced his writing style and themes.

					He was orpahaned after the death of his parents and adopted by John Allan, whose name he was given. Poe's work as a writer was greatly marked by his own life experiences; his expulsion from college, and trouble with his foster parents; his marriage to the young Virginia Clemm and the love that was never meant to be in his childhood sweetheart Sarah Royster; his experience in the military and numerous jobs in the writing industry; and finally, the death of Virginia Clemm and his alcoholism that eventually led to his own death.

					Poe is undoubtedly a master of the short story and is also considered to be the inventor of the modern detective story. In addition to this, his renditions of the gothic style and profound insights into the human psyche has made him one of most prolific and influential writers to have ever lived. Some of his works stand out more than others, and anyone that has ever had the pleasure of reading Poe's work will no doubt hold their own opinions on which stories are the best. I have selected a few that have left an impression on me and done brief review of each in the following section.

						Landor's Cottage is the very last story that Poe published - just four months before his death. The purpose of the story is clearly stated in a single sentence at its very end - though, the story has no purpose. This conundrum as it were, strikes at the heart of literature itself, and the question of what makes a good story 'good', is unavoidable if you were to read it. I will sumbit here, that Landor's Cottage is not a good story, yet - it has changed my entire outlook on literature. The demand for introspection as it concerns the purpose of writing that Poe places on the reader, has brought back to me the yearing of a childish imagination to be captivated and lost in a good book. For this reason and this reason alone, I would reccommend this story to anyone. Moreover, it is the reason that I cannot help but acknowledge that its worth to literature is grand and undeniable.

						Personally, I think that the obvious missing elements from Landor's Cottage are most definitely to be found in The Assignation. There is hardly any dialogue in this story, and yet through vivid imagery, a plot that involves an extramarital affair, and the attempted murder of a young child by his own mother unfolds itself with great precision. From the standpoint of the reader, the story progress and even climaxes as most stories would, with the reader himself playing the detective through Poe's masterful grasp of language and the human psyche. I could sing praises all day to this exceptional piece of literature and at the end I still would not have done it justice.
