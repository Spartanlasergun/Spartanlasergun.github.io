				<div class="plain_text">
					There is an immesurable world of ideas that are linked to the human mind and by extension to psychology. As a consequence, there have been no real attempts to formulate a list of psychological phenomena as there is no emprical means of drawing boundaries for classification. Were anyone to attempt such an endeavour, they would simply have put together a list of ideas that they themselves have fancied as being part of the psychological realm. Even if it were possible to produce an empirical list, you would still be faced with the unanswerable question of "what exactly is this list to be used for?" It has ever been the practice of psychologists and those who study the mind to investigate psychological problems at their own disrection, and the means of data collection that facilitates this necessarily narrows the focus of the researcher to no more than a handful of issues that he can explore during his short lifetime. Ergo, a list of psychological phenomena would for decades have been seen as useless and biased to no small degree.
					<br>
					<br>
					At present, things have changed in way that gives tremendous value to a list of psychological phenomena - empirical or otherwise. The reasons are simple:
					<div class="slide_box">
						<div class="slide_text" style="font-style:italic">
							1) Improvements in communication - the internet - has made it possible to gather large amounts of data in very short periods of time.
							<br>
							2) The means of assessing this data is no longer an issue with the advent of better computers and advanced machine learning techniques.
						</div>
					</div>
					As such, I have found it possible to suspend any trepidations that would hinder the creation of a list of psychological phenomena and have attempted to produce one that will facilitate my own research and understanding. In creating this list I have consulted with numerous resources inculding: 

					<div class="center_image" style="font-style:italic; font-weight:bold">
						Gale Encylopedia of Psychology
						<br>
						Source Two
						<br>
						Source Three
					</div>

					By examining known psychological phenomena and contrasting them with other concepts in psychology, patterns naturally emerge that can allow us to specify of rules for classification of psychological phenomena. This in turn allows us to avoid redundancy and unecessary overlap bewteen identified phenomena. This list of rules is given below with a brief explanation of their function.

				</div>

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="slide_text">
						1) Rule One: Genesis
						<div class="slide_text" style="font-style:italic">
							To distinguish between constructs that are the sole product of an interpersonal human experience, and psychological phenomena that exist irrespective of experience, a distinction is made to ensure that all phenomena identified have a sole genesis within the human mind. For example: The sociological construct of 'leadership' can be distinguished from the psychological phenomena that may constitute some part of its existence - personality, behaviour etc.
						</div>
						2) Rule Two: State-Process Duality
						<div class="slide_text" style="font-style:italic">
							Psychological Phenomena all possess properties of both a state and a process. This can mean either of the following:
							<div class="slide_text" style="font-style:italic"> 
								(a) It can represent a psychological construct that is prone to change while still describing a state of existence. For example: The process of 'binge eating' is not the same as the phenomena of 'behaviour'.
								<br> 
								(b) It can represent an implicit function of mind that facilitates learning via some process, and consequently influences our state of mind for the duration of the process. Example: Transference, Reinforcement and Conditioning all fall into this category.
							</div>
						</div>
						3) Rule Three: Sui Generis
						<div class="slide_text" style="font-style:italic">
							All psychological phenomena exists sui generis. One common way of testing this is to investigate and determine whether or not the phenomena in question possesses some natural antitheisis. Example: The natural antithesis of dominance is sumbmissiveness, and an investigation into one will no doubt paint a picture of the other. However, the governing psychological phenomena is 'Personality' which does not possess a natural antithesis.
						</div>
						4) Rule Four: Bio-Psychological Boundary
						<div class="slide_text" style="font-style:italic">
							Some ideas are complex enough to present as both biological and psychological in nature. In these cases, the phenomena is only treated as fundamentally psychological if the psychological mechanisms operate a priori in consideration of the idea as a whole. For example: 'Arousal' and 'Puberty' both contain biological and psychological mechanisms. In the case of Arousal, there is a fundamental psychological trigger, so we can consider this to be a psychological phenomenon. In the case of Puberty, the trigger is fundamentally biological and the psychological considerations follow a posteriori which means that it cannot be classified as a psychological phenomenon.
						</div>
						5) Rule Five: Empiricism
						<div class="slide_text" style="font-style:italic">
							Psychological Phenomena cannot be emprically quantified.
						</div>
						5) Rule Five: Healthy Functioning
						<div class="slide_text" style="font-style:italic">
							There are many phenomena that we do not understand, which are observed most in the functioning of unhealthy human minds. A distinction must be made to prevent errors in this regard. For example: Hallucinations and Delusions are both products of a dysfuntional mind, and cannot be considered to be naturally occuring psychological phenomena.
