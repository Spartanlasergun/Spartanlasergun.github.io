				<div class="plain_text">
					In the modern era of the computational social science I find myself faced with very unique problems where large scale data collection is concerned - particularly with respect to AI an machine learning projects. These problems arise because there is no objective framework for data collection where psychological phenomena is concerned. In addition to this, there is no empirical list of psychological phenomena that has been created to facilitate data collection.
					<br><br>
					To resolve some of these issues - indeed, not all of them - I have taken the liberty of curating my own list. The primary goal in creating this list is to prevent redundancy in data collection by identifying overlapping concepts and drawing distinct boundaries to resolve the phenomenological ambiguity that tends to occur where psychology meets neighbouring fields such as sociology and biology. This is accomplished through extensive research, and phenomena are classified as psychological based on the way in which their existence is empircally observed and validated. There are many key resources that have guided the creation of this list, including: the APA Dictonary of Psychology, and the Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology. An extensive list of these References/Resources have been provided in the last section of this page.

							Achievement Motivation
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="content_two">
						APA DEFINITION: The desire to perform well and be successful. In this sense, the term often is used synonymously with 'need for achievement'.
						<br><br>
						ORIGIN: Murray (1938), talked extensively about concepts such as 'needs' and 'drive' and has been acknowledged by many as the first to formally identify the concept. Additional work by Morgan & Murray (1935) on the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) also played a role in Achievement Motivation, as it was used by  McClelland (1961), to develop a procedure for the measurement of motives.
						<br><br>
						TESTING & VALIDITY: Murray & Morgan's Thematic Apperception Test was not an empirically valid psychometric construct - it was simply proposed and validated by the authors through no more rigour than their own logic could afford them. In Murray's book 'Explorations in Personality', he would frequently refer to his own work as being apart from academic psychology. This was negelcted by McClelland, who based his research in part on the Thematic Apperception Test. Research in this area continues to this day, but should be avoided if possible.
						<br><br>
						SCOPE: 'Achievement' by itself is not broadly studied in psychology - the exception being the narrow boundary of 'Achievement Motivation'. This also accounts in part for the study of 'Needs', 'Drive' and 'Motivation'. Achievement Testing does not constitute a unique branch of psychological testing - most standardized tests used in schools can be considered valid Achievement Tests.

						An unpleasant psychological state resulting from inconsistency between two or more elements in a cognitive system.
