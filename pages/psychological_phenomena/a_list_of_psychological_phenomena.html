				<div class="plain_text">
					In the modern era of the computational social science I find myself faced with very unique problems where large scale data collection is concerned - particularly with respect to AI an machine learning projects. These problems arise because there is no objective framework for data collection where psychological phenomena is concerned. In addition to this, there is no empirical list of psychological phenomena that has been created to facilitate data collection.
					<br><br>
					To resolve some of these issues - indeed, not all of them - I have taken the liberty of curating my own list. The primary goal in creating this list is to prevent redundancy in data collection by identifying overlapping concepts and drawing distinct boundaries to resolve the phenomenological ambiguity that tends to occur where psychology meets neighbouring fields such as sociology and biology. This is accomplished through extensive research, and phenomena are classified as psychological based on the way in which their existence is empircally observed and validated. There are many key resources that have guided the creation of this list, including: the APA Dictonary of Psychology, and the Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology. An extensive list of these References/Resources have been provided in the last section of this page.

						Achievement
					</div>
					<div class="content_two">
						APA DEFINITION: 1. The attainment of some goal, or the goal attained. 2. Acquired knowledge (especially in a particular subject), proficiency, or skill. The term is most often used in this sense to mean academic achievement.
						<br><br>
						ORIGIN: Achievement and Intelligence are two different but interrelated constructs (Kaya et al. 2015). However, testing in these areas possess the same roots in the Binet-Simon Intelligence Scale, which was meant to identify and assist with the education of children posessing a sub-normal intelligence (Binet & Simon, 1916).
						<br><br>
						TESTING & VALIDITY: Achievement testing is generally aligned with understanding a persons educational achievement, which is reflected by school curriculums and standardized testing that is the norm today (Kaya et al. 2015). Intelligence has been considerd the most important factor in predicting achievement outcomes and so tests of Intelligence are used broadly in assessing achievement from the psychological standpoint (Kaya et al. 2015). The combination of assessment using standardized tests along with psychometric measures of intelligence encapsulates the general approach to achievement testing (Kaya et al. 2015). The reliabilty and validty thereafter rests of the effectiveness of these instruments. (see INTELLIGENCE for more information)
						<br><br>
						SCOPE: The study of achievement encompasess many different areas including: Academic Achievement, Social Development, Emotional Development and Physical Development.

							Achievement Motivation
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="content_two">
						APA DEFINITION: The desire to perform well and be successful. In this sense, the term often is used synonymously with 'need for achievement'.
						<br><br>
						ORIGIN: Murray (1938), talked extensively about concepts such as 'needs' and 'drive' and has been acknowledged by many - including McClelland (1961), - as the first to formally identify the concept of Achievement Motivation (though his published work does not make specific mention of the term). Additionally, work done by Morgan & Murray (1935) on the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) also played a role in Achievement Motivation, as it was used by  McClelland (1961), to develop a procedure for the measurement of motives.
						<br><br>
						TESTING & VALIDITY: Murray & Morgan's TAT was not an empirically valid psychometric test, though there were many attempts to correct this over the years that followed (Vane, 1981). Research by McClelland (1961) on Achievement Motivation that utilized its own version of the TAT, marks one of the few attempts to use a TAT that is considered empirical by modern standards (Lilienfeld et al. 2000). As early as the 1980's hundreds of articles had been published on the TAT, with strong adherents and equally strong critics (Vane, 1981). In general, publication bias in the research around the TAT is incredibly prevalent (Lilienfeld et al. 2000), and research in this area should be avoided.
						<br><br>
						SCOPE: The study of Achievement Motivation may also account in part for the study of 'Needs', 'Drive', 'Motivation' and 'Self-Control'.

				<div class="table_content">
					<div class="content_one">Aptitude</div>
					<div class="content_two">
						APA DEFINITION: The capacity to acquire competence or skill through training. Specific aptitude is potential in a particular area (e.g., artistic or mathematical aptitude); general aptitude is potential in several fields. Both are distinct from ability, which is an existing competence.
						<br><br>
						ORIGIN: Aptitude testing orignates from the same place as Intelligence testing. Binet & Simon (1916) published the first empirical attempt at an intelligence test in 1905, but made clear that it's goal was to measure general intelligence in children. They stated that the measurement of aptitudes would be part of there future work - but within the same empirical paradigm that they used for the measure of general intelligence. (Date Discrepancy: Binet & Simon published their work in 1905, but the english translation cited here is dated '1916'.)

					<div class="content_one">Gender</div>
					<div class="content_two">
						APA DEFINITION: The condition of being male, female, or neuter. In a human context, the distinction between gender and sex reflects the usage of these terms: Sex usually refers to the biological aspects of maleness or femaleness, whereas gender implies the psychological, behavioral, social, and cultural aspects of being male or female (i.e., masculinity or femininity).
						<br><br>
						ORIGIN: The academic study of gender is rooted in early feminism that adopted the term for various reasons including (but not limited to) the fact that it was much less politcaly charged as compared to the term 'women', and it enforced or implied a context of study with a natural counterpart - men - thereby asserting the need for contextual rather than isolated studies of women (Scott, 1986). The use of the term Gender also made it possible to escape the explicit biological foundations of sex, to a much broader conception of the relationship between sexes (Scott, 1986).
						<br><br>
						TESTING & VALIDITY: In consideration of Gender as a psychological phenomenon, the body of research that exists in the field is relegated to three major areas: Gender Bias, Gender Constancy and Gender Identity (Strickland, 2001).
						<br><br>
						SCOPE: Gender Bias, Gender Identity

					<div class="content_one">Intelligence</div>
					<div class="content_two">
						APA DEFINITION: The ability to derive information, learn from experience, adapt to the environment, understand, and correctly utilize thought and reason.
						<br><br>
						ORIGIN: Prior to the year 1905, the standards for diagnosis of inferior intelligence in children was completely arbitrary, and based on a subjective assessment administered by the presiding physician (Binet & Simon 1916). Binet & Simon (1916) published the Binet-Simon Intelligence Scale in 1905 to attempt to address this issue, and while their test would not pass the standards of modern research, the general paradigm that they put forth is a major part of the foundation for all psychological testing that has followed. (Date Discrepancy: Binet & Simon published their work in 1905, but the english translation cited here is dated '1916'.)
						<br><br>
						TESTING & VALIDITY: There have been many different theories of intelligence that have been put forth since the Binet-Simon Intelligence scale, with the disagreement ultimately resulting in many different conceptions of how to measure intelligence (Kaya et al., 2015). Empiricism thereafter becomes a question of theoretical bias, as there are as many ways to measure intelligence as there are definitions of intelligence (Kaya et al., 2015). Intelligence tests are generally considered to be among the most reliable of all psychometric test that exist in the field (Gottfredson, 1997)VERIFY. Most criticisms of Intelligence test come from the inappropriate usage of the test or misinterpretation of results (Gottfredson & Saklofske, 2009)VERIFY.
