					In statistics, Numerical Data can generally be divided into to types: Discreet data and Continuous Data. The distinction between these two types of data is an intuitive one and it has a lot to do with how we collect data in the real world. With this in mind, it is important to understand that data classification in this regard is an intuitive process and requires a great conceptual understanding to be applied to real world problems. However, we begin with the simple distinction between Discreet and Continuous data, because it offers us a great of initial structure that can take us into much broader concepts.

						Discrete data consists of separate, distinct values that are typically whole numbers or counts. These values cannot be subdivided further and are often the result of counting or categorizing. Discrete data is characterized by gaps or interruptions between values. Examples of discrete data include the number of children in a family (e.g., 1, 2, 3), the number of cars in a parking lot, or the number of students in a classroom. Discrete data is typically represented using bar charts, histograms, or frequency tables.

					<div class="slide_text">
						Continuous data, on the other hand, is data that can take on any value within a specific range or interval. It is measured on a continuous scale and can be divided into infinitely small intervals. Continuous data is characterized by a smooth and uninterrupted flow of values. Examples of continuous data include measurements such as height, weight, time, temperature, and distance. Continuous data is often represented using line graphs, scatter plots, or frequency curves.

				<div class="plain_text">
					So what are the other types of data? Well the answer to that question is not a simple one as it is in fact quite a long list. But, there are a few more fundamental distinctions that we can make before things get too complex. Specifically I am referring to various ways of grouping data - also understood as 'scales of measurement'. There are four of these scales that are commonly used in statistics known as Nominal, Ordinal, Interval and Ratio data. The common mathematical thread between all of these is the use of 'Frequency'. Frequency is quite simple, but still too technical for this section which I have intended primarily for a theoretical discussion of these ideas. The underlying math that gives them their utility in the real world will be discussed later on.
