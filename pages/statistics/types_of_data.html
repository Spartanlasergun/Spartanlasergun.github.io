					In statistics, Numerical Data can generally be divided into to types: Discreet data and Continuous Data. The distinction between these two types of data is an intuitive one and it has a lot to do with how we collect data in the real world. With this in mind, it is important to understand that data classification in this regard is an intuitive process and requires a great conceptual understanding to be applied to real world problems. However, we begin with the simple distinction between Discreet and Continuous data, because it offers us a great of initial structure that can take us into much broader concepts.

						Discrete data consists of separate, distinct values that are typically whole numbers or counts. These values cannot be subdivided further and are often the result of counting or categorizing. Discrete data is characterized by gaps or interruptions between values. Examples of discrete data include the number of children in a family (e.g., 1, 2, 3), the number of cars in a parking lot, or the number of students in a classroom. Discrete data is typically represented using bar charts, histograms, or frequency tables.

					<div class="slide_text">
						Continuous data, on the other hand, is data that can take on any value within a specific range or interval. It is measured on a continuous scale and can be divided into infinitely small intervals. Continuous data is characterized by a smooth and uninterrupted flow of values. Examples of continuous data include measurements such as height, weight, time, temperature, and distance. Continuous data is often represented using line graphs, scatter plots, or frequency curves.

				<div class="plain_text">
					So what are the other types of data? Well the answer to that question is not a simple one as it is in fact quite a long list. But, there are a few more fundamental distinctions that we can make before things get too complex. Specifically, I am referring to various ways of grouping data - also understood as 'scales of measurement'. There are four of these scales that are commonly used in statistics known as Nominal, Ordinal, Interval and Ratio data. Of these data types, Nominal and Ordinal data is Discrete, whereas Interval and Ratio data is continuous.

						Nominal data, is a type of data that represents different categories or groups. It is characterized by its qualitative nature, where the values are non-numeric and do not have any inherent order or ranking. Examples of nominal data include gender (male/female), marital status (single/married/divorced), eye color (blue/brown/green), and types of animals (dog/cat/bird). Statistical analysis on this type of data is typically limited to frequency counts and proportions.

						Ordinal data is a type of data that represents categories or groups with an assigned order or ranking. Common examples of ordinal data include satisfaction ratings (e.g., very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied, very satisfied) and educational levels (e.g., high school, bachelor's degree, master's degree, PhD). In statistical analysis, common techniques used with ordinal data include calculating frequencies, computing measures of central tendency (e.g., median), and conducting non-parametric tests such as the Mann-Whitney U test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="slide_text">
						Interval data is a type of quantitative data that categorizes datapoints based on meaningful intervals. In other words, the numerical values assigned to the data points represent meaningful intervals that have consistent differences. An example of interval data is temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit. The difference between 10째C and 20째C is the same as the difference between 30째C and 40째C. However, interval data does not have a true zero point, meaning that a value of zero does not indicate the absence of the attribute being measured. Cumulative Frequency graphs along with linear interpolation often provides very meaningful estimates of central tendency along with other descriptors, for this type of data.

						Ratio data is a type of quantitative data that represents quantities or amounts that can be measured on a continuous scale. It has a consistent measurement scale with equal intervals between values and a true zero point. This allows for meaningful ratios and proportions between values. Common examples of ratio data include weight, height, time duration, distance, and counts of occurrences. When analyzing ratio data, statistical techniques such as calculating means, standard deviations, conducting t-tests, correlation analysis, and regression analysis can be applied.
