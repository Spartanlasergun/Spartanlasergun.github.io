					In writing this section I have had to consider many things; but primarily, that as a subject mathematics can get as deep as a person wants it too. Accordingly, with my own bias I have found that certain concepts warrant a deep theoretical exploration, whilist others can simply be touched upon. I have done my best to thread the basics of statistics here, without overlooking any one concept in a fashion that may constitute neglect. Where things have been overlooked, I have stated so briefly so as to allow the reader to explore the broader treatise on the subject as he/she desires.

						Mode and Median

					<div class="slide_text">
						Consider the dataset:

						\[0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 6, 10, 2, 4, 3, 3, 5\]

						The mode in any given dataset is the most frequently occuring value. In this case the most frequent value in the dataset is the number \(3\). Hence the mode of the dataset is 3.
						<br><br>

						The median in any given dataset is the middle number. Sorting our dataset in ascending order, we have:

						\[0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 10\]

						The middle number in this dataset is \(3\). Hence, the median of the dataset is three.
						<br><br>
						Both the mode and median are measures of central tendency. Though it may not seem like it, the use of the mode and median in the real world is extremely important and is based very much on the type of data that a statistician may be working with.

						Mean
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="slide_text">
						For any given dataset, the arithmetic mean is the sum of all the datapoints, divided by the number of existing datapoints in the given dataset, i.e.
						
						\[\bar x = \frac{\Sigma x}{n}\]

						As shown above, the mean is denoted by the symbol \(\bar x\) for any dataset \(x_1, x_2, x_3, ... x_i\).

						Hence, for a given dataset \((5, 10, 15, 20)\), the mean is given by:

						\[\bar x = \frac{5 + 10 + 15 + 20}{4}\]

						\[\bar x = 12.5\]

						The mean is a measure of central tendency, much like the mode and the median, and can be more or less useful than the others in real life based on the nature of the data that you are working with. The circumstantial usefulness of the mean will be discussed later on in the section dealing with grouped and ungrouped data.

						Frequency

					<div class="slide_text">
						Frequency is one of the more general ideas in statistics. It is a measurment for the number of occurences in a dataset that can be classified catergorically in a grouped or ungrouped manner. This may sound complex, but it is not. Consider the following dataset:
						<table>	
						  <tr>
						    <th>Height (cm)</th>
						    <th>150</th>
						    <th>151</th>
						    <th>152</th>
						    <th>153</th>
						    <th>154</th>
						  </tr>
						  <tr>
						    <td>No. of Children</td>
						    <td>5</td>
						    <td>8</td>
						    <td>15</td>
						    <td>3</td>
						    <td>6</td>
						  </tr>
						</table>
