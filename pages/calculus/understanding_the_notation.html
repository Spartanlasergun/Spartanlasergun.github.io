					Most of us take for granted that calculus has a very unique notation when compared to other branches of mathematics. Ignoring the fancy symbols usually allows us to understand the basic arithmetic involved in solving simple calculus problems, but an intuitive understanding of how we arrive at these symbols is important if you wish to take calculus into the real world. So this section is dedicated to a step by step explanation that will explore the fundamental thinking that has shaped the modern notation as we understand it.

						Expression of Functions

					<div class="plain_text">
						We will begin with a look at Dependent and Independent Variables in mathematics.
						Consider the formula for the volume of a sphere:
						\[V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
						In this formula, the independent variable is \(r\). This is because \(r\) is not dependent on any other varible to determine its value. Conversely, \(V\) is the dependent variable. We can say, that the variation of \(V\), is dependent upon variation of \(r\).
						<br>
						<br>
						This seems intuitive when we consider common mathematical formulae, but what about something a bit more complex like a quadratic equation?
						\[y = ax^2 + bx + c\]
						Well, the reasoning does not change. In the above equation, \(x\) is the independent variable as it is not reliant on any other variable to determine its value. Accordingly, \(y\) is dependent, as any variation in \(y\) is dependent on variation in \(x\).
						<br>
						<br>
						Why is this understanding of dependent and independent variables important? Well for all intent an purposes, the dependent variable is can be considered a function that is described by the independent variables. This is usually expressed as follows:
						\[f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\]
						\(y\) becomes \(f(x)\). 
						<br>
						Changes in this function can be expressed as:
						\[f(2) = (2)x^2 + (2)x + c\]
						\[f(3) = (3)x^2 + (3)x + c\]
						\[f(10) = (10)x^2 + (10)x + c\]
						If we were dealing with some other independent variable - perhaps those found in trigonometric functions, we would write:
						\[f(\theta) = sin\theta^2 - cos\theta^2\]
						This idea of a function is brought about by the idea of change - particularly, the idea that changes one side of an equation results in changes on the other side. So, what happens when change itself becomes the variable that we are concerned with?

						Rates of Change
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="slide_text">
						In mathematics, if we take any variable \(x\), the symbol \(\delta x\) is used to denote change in that variable. The letter \(\delta\), is the greek symbol delta. Much like \(f(x)\), it is not its own variable and should not be separated from the variable \(x\). When we talk about \(\delta x\) or \(\delta y\), we are refering to 'changes' (i.e. increases or decreases) rather than an independent value, and so these changes are functions themselves. The fact that we are mathematically referring to the idea of 'change' is part of the key intuition behind the real world application of calculus. We will dive deeper into this in later sections.
						<br>
						<br>
						For now, lets consider two random variables, \(x\) and \(y\). If the variable \(x\) is then increased by and amount \(\delta x\), then the variable \(y\) will also change by an amount denoted by \(\delta y\).
						Accordingly:
						\[y = f(x)\]
						\[y + \delta y = f(x + \delta x)\]
						And now this may look a bit interesting:
						\[\delta y = f(x + \delta x) - f(x)\]
