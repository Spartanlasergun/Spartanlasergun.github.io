				</div>

				<div class="separator"></div>

				<div class="plain_text">
					Most of us take for granted that calculus has a very unique notation when compared to other branches of mathematics. Ignoring the fancy symbols usually allows us to understand the basic arithmetic involved in solving simple calculus problems, but an intuitive understanding of how we arrive at these symbols is important if you wish to take calculus into the real world. So this section is dedicated to a step by step explanation that will explore the fundamental thinking that has shaped the modern notation as we understand it.

						Expression of Functions
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="plain_text">
						We will begin with a look at Dependent and Independent Variables in mathematics.
						Consider the formula for the volume of a sphere:
						\[V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
						In this formula, the independent variable is \(r\). This is because \(r\) is not dependent on any other varible to determine its value. Conversely, \(V\) is the dependent variable. We can say, that the variation of \(V\), is dependent upon variation of \(r\).
						<br>
						<br>
						This seems intuitive when we consider common mathematical formulae, but what about something a bit more complex like a quadratic equation?
						\[y = ax^2 + bx + c\]
						Well, the reasoning does not change. In the above equation, \(x\) is the independent variable as it is not reliant on any other variable to determine its value. Accordingly, \(y\) is dependent, as any variation in \(y\) is dependent on variation in \(x\).
						<br>
						<br>
						Why is this understanding of dependent and independent variables important? Well for all intent an purposes, the dependent variable is can be considered a function that is described by the independent variables. This is usually expressed as follows:
						\[f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\]
						\(y\) becomes \(f(x)\). 
						<br>
						Changes in this function can be expressed as:
						\[f(2) = (2)x^2 + (2)x + c\]
						\[f(3) = (3)x^2 + (3)x + c\]
						\[f(10) = (10)x^2 + (10)x + c\]
						If we were dealing with some other independent variable - perhaps those found in trigonometric functions, we would write:
						\[f(\theta) = sin\theta^2 - cos\theta^2\]
						This idea of a function is brought about by the idea of change - particularly, the idea that changes one side of an equation results in changes on the other side. So, what happens when change itself becomes the variable that we are concerned with?

						Rates of Change
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="slide_text">
						In mathematics, if we take any variable \(x\), the symbol \(\delta x\) is used to denote change in that variable. The letter \(\delta\), is the greek symbol delta. Much like \(f(x)\), it is not its own variable and should not be separated from the variable \(x\). When we talk about \(\delta x\) or \(\delta y\), we are refering to 'changes' (i.e. increases or decreases) rather than an independent value, and so these changes are functions themselves. The fact that we are mathematically referring to the idea of 'change' is part of the key intuition behind the real world application of calculus. We will dive deeper into this in later sections.
						<br>
						<br>
						For now, lets consider two random variables, \(x\) and \(y\). If the variable \(x\) is then increased by and amount \(\delta x\), then the variable \(y\) will also change by an amount denoted by \(\delta y\).
						Accordingly:
						\[y = f(x)\]
						\[y + \delta y = f(x + \delta x)\]
						And now this may look a bit interesting:
						\[\delta y = f(x + \delta x) - f(x)\]

						Limits
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="slide_text">
						Consider the simple function:
						\[y = \frac{1}{x}\]
						If we decrease the values of \(x\), the values of \(y\) begin to increase. Subsequently, as \(x\) increases \(y\) gets smaller and smaller but will never truly reach zero. In fact the numbers can get small enough that it may be extremely difficult to represent them mathematically, and so we say that \(x\) approaches infinity (\(\infty\)). This is not a number by which we can operate, but when the function \(\frac{1}{x}\) becomes infinitly large, we can represent it with \(\frac{1}{\infty}\).

				</div>

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="slide_text">
						The graph produced from this function is very commonly called an asymptote. As \(x\) approaches infinity the x-axis itself becomes tangential to the curve. Likewise, if we were to decrease values of \(x\) to an infinitly small number, the \(y\) values would begin to approach infinity and the y-axis would be tangential to the curve at this point as well. (This is illustrated in the graph above).
						<br>
						Algebraically, this can be expressed as:
						 
						\[when \ x \to \infty \ , \ \frac{1}{x} \to 0 \]

						\[when \ x \to 0 \ , \ \frac{1}{x} \to \infty \]

						Now we arrive at a more interesting question. We have considered the function \(y = \frac{1}{x}\), as values of \(x\) approach \(\infty\), but consider the following function:
						\[f(x) = \frac{2x}{1 + x}\]
						What happens as values of \(x\) approach infinity for this function? Moreover, in contemplation of this question, can we derive any meaning from a fraction of the form \(\frac{\infty}{\infty}\)? We can solve this problem as follows:
						\[f(x) = \frac{2x}{1 + x}\]
						By dividing the numerator and denominator by \(x\):
						\[f(x) = \frac{2}{1 + \frac{1}{x}}\]
						\[Hence, \ x \to \infty \ , \ \frac{1}{x} \to 0\]
						Consequently, the limit of the function is defined at:
						\[f(x) = \frac{2}{1 + 0} = 2\]
						Thus, \(2\) is said to be the limit with which \(\frac{2x}{1 +x}\) approaches infinity. The notation for expressing this limit is as follows:
						\[\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{2x}{1 + x} = 2 \]

								Limits of the form \(\frac{0}{0}\)
							</div>
						</div>
						The general understanding of limits has been conveyed so far, but there is another special case to consider, and that is the limit of a function of the form \(\frac{0}{0}\). Let us consider the following function:
						\[f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2} \]
						It will be noticed, that it would be quite easy to solve this function for any value of \(x\). However, when \(x\) has a value of two, the solution is given by \(\frac{0}{0}\). This is a mathematical impossibility. But lets examine a few solutions that are just shy of \(2\).
						\[f(2.1) = \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2} =  4.1\]
						\[f(2.01) = \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2} =  4.01\]
						\[f(1.9) = \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2} =  3.9\]
						\[f(1.99) = \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2} =  3.99\]
						By examining these results it is easy to see that as \(x\) approaches \(2\), the function \(\frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2}\) approaches a value of \(4\). Hence:
						\[as \ \ \ \ \ x \to 2 \ , \ \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2} \to 4 \]
						Let us consider a problem that is a bit more theoretical. Consider the function:
						\[f(x) = \frac{x^2 - a^2}{x - a} \]
						We will note, that as \(x\) approaches \(a\) in value, we get closer to a limit of the form \(\frac{0}{0}\). Let us then express this theoretical approach to \(a\) as \(a + h\). And hence, let:
						\[x = a + h\]
						In using this approach, our function will always have a clear solution as values of \(x\) will never equal \(a\), but will always maintain a distance of some value '\(h\)'. Substituting into our original function, we get:
						\[\frac{(a + h)^2 - a^2}{a + h - a}\]
						Reducing to:
						\[\frac{2ah + h^2}{h}\]
						and dividing by \(h\), we get:
						\[f(a + h) = 2a + h\]
						and \(f(x)\) is defined for all values of \(x\) than can be represented by \(2a + h\). Hence:
						\[\frac{x^2 - a^2}{x - a} = 2a + h\]
						As \(x\) approaches \(a\), \(h\) approaches \(0\), and:
						\(\frac{x^2 - a^2}{x - a}\) approaches \(2a\). This means that \(2a\) is the limiting value of our function, and this can be expressed as:
						\[\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{x^2 - a^2}{x - a} = 2a \]

								Theorems on Limits
							</div>
						</div>
						The following are four theorems on limits:
						<br>
						1) If two variables are equal, their limits are always equal
						<br>
						2) The limit of the sum of any number of functions is equal to the sum of the limits of separate functions. Hence, if \(u\) and \(v\) are functions of \(x\), then:
						\[\lim{(u + v)} = \lim{(u)} + \lim{(v)} \]
						3) The limit of a product of any number of functions, is equal to the product of the limits of the separate functions. Hence, if \(u\) and \(v\) are functions of \(x\), then:
						\[\lim{(uv)} = \lim{(u)} * \lim{(v)} \]
						4) The limit of the quotient of two functions is equal to the quotient of the limit of the separate functions, provided that the limit of the divisor is non-zero.  Hence, if \(u\) and \(v\) are functions of \(x\), then:
						\[\lim{(\frac{u}{v})} = \frac{\lim{(u)}}{\lim{(v)}} \ \ , \ provided \ \ \lim{(v)} \neq 0 \]
