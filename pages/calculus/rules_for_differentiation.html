					The theoretical conception of the differential coefficient is the foundation of calculus, but there are broader rules for its application in the algebraic sense. These rules are no less theoretical, and they are meant to address the application of calculus to more complex problems invloving multiple variables and combinations of functions. This section will discuss how these things are done with respect to the first principles of calculus.

						There are several elementary rules that serve as guidelines for applying calculus to more complex problems. These are known as the Product Rule, the Quotient Rule, and the Chain Rule. It's important to discuss the implications of these rules beforehand, because while they are a great starting point for a more complex understanding of calculus, they are just blunt instruments shaped by the first principles of calculus. Consequently, they serve little more than to develop one's intuition for algebraic manipulations of problems involving differentials. In this respect, I would advise giving greater consideration to their proofs rather than taking the identities wholesale.

						The Product Rule
					</div>					
				</div>

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="slide_text">
						Starting with the product rule, we will first consider trying to differentiate a function that is a product of two other functions, i.e.
						\[f(x) = f(u) * f(v) \]

						Or more simply,

						\[y = u * v\]

						To differentiate the above function, we can begin by applying the first principles to the problem. That is to say, that an infinitely small increase in \(y\), given by \(\delta y\), results in an infinitely small increase in \(u\) and \(v\), given by \(\delta u\) and \(\delta v\).

						\[y + \delta y = (u + \delta u)(v + \delta v)\]

						Expanding we get:

						\[y + \delta y = uv + u\delta v + v\delta u + \delta u\delta v\]

						Since \(y = uv\)

						\[uv + \delta y = uv + u\delta v + v\delta u + \delta u\delta v\]

						\[\delta y = u\delta v + v\delta u + \delta u\delta v\]

						Recall, that our differential coefficient is the limit of the ratio of infinitely small changes in any two variables. Most typically represented by \(\delta y\) and \(\delta x\) - 

						\[\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}\]

						We divide through by \(\delta x\), so that all parts of the function are changing with respect to the same variable. This gives us:

						\[\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = u\frac{\delta v}{\delta x} + v\frac{\delta u}{\delta x} + \delta u\frac{\delta v}{\delta x}\]

						Since all parts of the function are changing with respect to \(\delta x\), as \(\delta x\) approaches \(0\), \(\delta y\), \(\delta u\), and \(\delta v\) will all approach zero. We can use this information to assess the limit of the function and obtain a unqiue expression for the differential coefficient of products. Assessing the limit:

						\[\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = u\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta v}{\delta x} + v\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta u}{\delta x} + \delta u\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta v}{\delta x}\]

						In the above expression, as \(\delta x \to 0\), \(\delta u \to 0\). Hence,

						\[\delta u\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta v}{\delta x} = 0\]

						The other limits, \(\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}\), \(\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta v}{\delta x}\), and \(\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta u}{\delta x}\) cannot be simplified or assessed without using the identity for the differential coefficient itself. This leaves us with:

						\[\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = u\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta v}{\delta x} + v\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta u}{\delta x}\]

						Or,

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = u\frac{dv}{dx} + v\frac{du}{dx}\]

						We can use the above identity to solve for the differential of any product of functions - especially in cases where the product itself is difficult to simplify. An example is given below.

						<div class="separator"></div>

						<div class="sub_section">
							<div class="sub_section_heading">
								Example
							</div>							
						</div>

						Consider the expression:

						\[(x^2 - 5)(x^2 + 5)\]

						We can apply our product identity to easily solve for the differential. 

						\[let \ \ u = x^2 - 5\]
						
						\[let \ \ v = x^2 + 5\]

						\[\frac{du}{dx} = 2x\]

						\[\frac{dv}{dx} = 2x\]

						Using our identity:

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = u\frac{dv}{dx} + v\frac{du}{dx}\]

						Hence,

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = (x^2 - 5)(2x) + (x^2 + 5)(2x)\]

						Simplifying:

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x^3 - 10x + 2x^3 + 10x\]

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = 4x^3\]

						<div class="separator"></div>

						If thus far, you're not impressed by the product rule, then you're in the right frame of mind. It would have been easy to simply expand the expression in the above example and differentiate each term individually - arguably even easier than applying a complicated identity relating two functions. To understand the value in the product rule, we have to go deeper into the lions den.

						The Quotient Rule
					</div>					
				</div>

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="slide_text">
						The quotient rule is similar to the product rule, but instead of a product, we are considering the derivative of a quotient. Consider the following function:

						\[y = \frac{u}{v}\]

						Now, lets apply our first principles so that we can solve for the differential coefficient.

						\[y + \delta y = \frac{u + \delta u}{v + \delta v}\]

						We know that \(y = \frac{u}{v}\), hence

						\[\frac{u}{v} + \delta y = \frac{u + \delta u}{v + \delta v}\]

						and simplyfying, we get

						\[(\frac{u}{v} + \delta y)(v + \delta v) = u + \delta u \]

						\[u + \frac{u}{v}\delta v + v\delta y + \delta y\delta v = u + \delta u \]

						\[\frac{u}{v}\delta v + v\delta y + \delta y\delta v = \delta u \]

						\[\delta y(v + \delta v) = \delta u - \frac{u}{v}\delta v \]

						\[v\delta y(v + \delta v) = v\delta u - u\delta v\]

						\[v\delta y = \frac{v\delta u - u\delta v}{v + \delta v}\]

						\[\delta y = \frac{v\delta u - u\delta v}{v^2 + v\delta v}\]

						Recall, the differential coefficient if the limit of ratio of infinitely small changes in any two variables. We can divide by \(\delta x\) so that all parts of the function are changing with respect to infinitely small changes given by \(\delta x\). Hence, we will obtain the following expression:

						\[\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = \frac{v\frac{\delta u}{\delta x} - u\frac{\delta v}{\delta x}}{v^2 + v\delta v}\]

						Now we can assess the \(\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\) and obtain the differential coefficient:

						\[\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = \frac{v\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta u}{\delta x} - u\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta v}{\delta x}}{v^2 + v\delta v}\]

						As \(\delta x \to 0\), \(\delta y \to 0\), \(\delta u \to 0\), and \(\delta v \to 0\). Hence, our lone \(\delta v\) in the denominator resolves to \(0\) leaving us with :

						\[\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = \frac{v\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta u}{\delta x} - u\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta v}{\delta x}}{v^2}\]

						Or more succinctly, we have the differential coefficient of a quotient as:

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{v\frac{du}{dx} - u\frac{dv}{dx}}{v^2}\]

						This identity for a quotient can be applied when attempting to different any function of the form \(y = \frac{u}{v}\). An example of this is given below.

						<div class="separator"></div>

						<div class="sub_section">
							<div class="sub_section_heading">
								Example
							</div>							
						</div>

						Consider the function:

						\[y = \frac{x + 1}{x + 2}\]

						There is no easy way to differentiate this through simple algebraic manipulation of the terms. However, we can apply our identity for the differential coefficient of a quotient to solve the problem.

						\[let \ \ u = x + 1\]

						\[let \ \ v = x + 2\]

						We know from our identity that 

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{v\frac{du}{dx} - u\frac{dv}{dx}}{v^2}\]

						Solving for \(\frac{du}{dx}\) and \(\frac{dv}{dx}\):

						\[\frac{du}{dx} = 1\]

						\[\frac{dv}{dx} = 1\]

						Substituting into our identity:

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{(x + 2)(1) - (x + 1)(1)}{(x + 2)^2}\]

						Simplifying:

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{x + 2 - x - 1}{(x + 2)^2}\]

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{(x + 2)^2}\]

						<div class="separator"></div>

						Perhaps now you're a tad more impressed with the quotient rule than the product rule. After all, there was no was to simplify the expression to easily obtain the differential - and the quotient rule served great purpose to that end. However, I advise caution. As stated in the beginning, the quotient rule should be considered no more than a passing fancy in the world of calculus. It's the principle of its derivation that ultimately is of use. Before I can illustrate this, we have one more rule to explore - the chain rule.

						The Chain Rule
					</div>					
				</div>

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="slide_text">
						We've explored the product rule, and we've explored the quotient rule, and now its time we explore the CHAIN rule - which is very simple. While the product rule and the quotient rule explore differential identities where conbinations of functions are concerned, the chain rule is concerned with differentiating a function of a function. This is best illustrated rather than explained. Consider the following function:

						\[y = (x^2 - 4)^5\]

						Now, there's no easy way to differentiate using the product or quotient rule. Perhaps we can use an exhaustive method and expand the expression until we have individual terms that we can easily differentiate, but there is a simpler way.
						Consider the following:

						\[let \ \ u = x^2 - 4\]

						Hence,

						\[y = u^5\]

						Now we must make a slight leap in logic. We want the differential coefficient - \(\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}\). Considering that we have easily differentiable expressions in terms of \(y\) and \(u\), we can examine the following:

						\[\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = \frac{\delta u}{\delta x} * \frac{\delta y}{\delta u}\]

						By simple rule of fractions, the above equation should resolve to give us \(\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}\). And if we apply the laws of limits we can obtain a function for our differential coefficient, i.e.

						\[\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = \lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta u}{\delta x} * \lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta u}\]

						Hence,

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{du}{dx} * \frac{dy}{du}\]

						Applying this to our function of \(u\) and \(y\), we get:

						\[\frac{du}{dx} = 2x\]

						and

						\[\frac{dy}{du} = 5u^4\]

						Since \(u = x^2 - 4\)

						\[\frac{dy}{du} = 5(x^2 - 4)^4\]

						And applying our identity for a function of a function,

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{du}{dx} * \frac{dy}{du}\]

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x * 5(x^2 - 4)^4\]

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = 10x(x^2 - 4)^4\]

						<div class="separator"></div>

						And thats the end of the chain rule. Of course, more complex functions require using combinations of the chain rule and product rule, or chain rule and quotient rule, and its there that these elementary rules really begin to shine. However, math problems can get extraordinarily complex, and in many cases we have to consider adaptations of what we've learnt in principle from deriving these simpler rules. Going forward I'd like to consider two cases - the first is a unique derivation that you will seldom ever encounter, and the second is the application of our rules to implicitly defined functions. Both of these things require the ability to conceptualize the differential coefficient from first principles and understanding them is crucial to the application of calculus to the real world.

						Consider the following function:

						\[y = x\frac{\sqrt{1 - x}}{\sqrt{1 + x}}\]

						We can make this a bit more readable as:

						\[y = \frac{x(1 - x)^{\frac{1}{2}}}{(1 + x)^{\frac{1}{2}}}\]

						There is no easy way to simply this function for differentiation. We might consider applying our product or quotient rules, but the function is ultimately an expression containing both a product and a quotient. In this case it is of the form:

						\[y = \frac{uv}{w}\]

						In order to solve it, we must understand the principles with which we were able to derive the product and quotient rules, and apply them to obtain an identity for the unique combination of functions given by \(y = \frac{uv}{w}\). This is why I have stressed that the product, quotient, and chain rules are not end's in themselves. They are simply blunt instruments - and an astute mind should be concerned with their creation much more than their application.
						<br>
						<br>
						Lets begin to solve our problem. We have the function:

						\[y = \frac{uv}{w}\]

						Applying our first principles, we can say that

						\[y + \delta y = \frac{(u + \delta u)(v + \delta v)}{w + \delta w}\]

						Expanding, we get

						\[y + \delta y = \frac{uv + u\delta v + v\delta u + \delta u\delta v}{w + \delta w}\]

						Since \(y = \frac{uv}{w}\),

						\[\frac{uv}{w} + \delta y = \frac{uv + u\delta v + v\delta u + \delta u\delta v}{w + \delta w}\]

						\[\delta y = \frac{uv + u\delta v + v\delta u + \delta u\delta v}{w + \delta w} - \frac{uv}{w}\]

						\[\delta y = \frac{w(uv + u\delta v + v\delta u + \delta u\delta v) - uv(w + \delta w)}{w(w + \delta w)}\]

						\[\delta y = \frac{uvw + uw\delta v + vw\delta u + w\delta u\delta v - uvw - uv\delta w}{w^2 + w\delta w}\]

						\[\delta y = \frac{uw\delta v + vw\delta u + w\delta u\delta v - uv\delta w}{w^2 + \delta w}\]

						As has been done so many times before, we are trying to obtain an expression in terms of the differential coefficient, \(\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}\) - hence, we divide through by \(\delta x\). This gives us

						\[\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = \frac{uw\frac{\delta v}{\delta x} + vw\frac{\delta u}{\delta x} + w\delta u\frac{\delta v}{\delta x} - uv\frac{\delta w}{\delta x}}{w^2 + w\delta w}\]

						Applying limits to our problem, we know that as \(\delta x \to 0\), \(\delta y \to 0\), \(\delta u \to 0\), \(\delta v \to 0\) and \(\delta w \to 0\). Hence,

						\[\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = \frac{uw\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta v}{\delta x} + vw\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta u}{\delta x} + w\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\delta u\frac{\delta v}{\delta x} - uv\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta w}{\delta x}}{w^2 + w\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\delta w}\]

						Thus we have

						\[\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = \frac{uw\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta v}{\delta x} + vw\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta u}{\delta x} - uv\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta w}{\delta x}}{w^2}\]

						Or more succintly, in terms of the differential coefficient, we have

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{uw\frac{dv}{dx} + vw\frac{du}{dx} - uv\frac{dw}{dx}}{w^2}\]

						Now we have an identity that we can use to solve our problem. Recall, the initial function,

						\[y = \frac{x(1 - x)^{\frac{1}{2}}}{(1 + x)^{\frac{1}{2}}}\]

						Solving,

						\[let \ \ u = x\]
						\[let \ \ v = (1 - x)^{\frac{1}{2}}\]
						\[let \ \ w = (1 + x)^{\frac{1}{2}}\]

						We can easily solve \(\frac{du}{dx}\)

						\[\frac{du}{dx} = 1\]

						Solving for \(\frac{dv}{dx}\) we apply the chain rule

						\[\frac{dv}{dx} = \frac{dv}{dr} * \frac{dr}{dx} \]

						\[let \ \ r = 1 - x\]

						\[hence \ \ v = r^{\frac{1}{2}}\]

						\[\frac{dr}{dx} = -1\]

						\[\frac{dv}{dr} = \frac{1}{2}(r)^{\frac{-1}{2}}\]

						\[\frac{dv}{dr} = \frac{1}{2}(1 - x)^{\frac{-1}{2}}\]

						\[\frac{dv}{dr} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1 - x}}\]

						hence,

						\[\frac{dv}{dx} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1 - x}} * -1\]

						\[\frac{dv}{dx} = \frac{-1}{2\sqrt{1 - x}}\]

						Solving for \(\frac{dw}{dx}\) we apply the chain rule

						\[let \ \ s = 1 + x\]

						\[hence \ \ w = s^{\frac{1}{2}}\]

						\[\frac{ds}{dx} = 1\]

						\[\frac{dw}{ds} = \frac{1}{2}(s)^{\frac{-1}{2}}\]

						\[\frac{dw}{ds} = \frac{1}{2}(1 + x)^{\frac{-1}{2}}\]

						\[\frac{dw}{ds} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1 + x}}\]

						hence,

						\[\frac{dw}{dx} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1 + x}} * 1\]

						\[\frac{dw}{dx} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1 + x}}\]


						Given our identity,

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{uw\frac{dv}{dx} + vw\frac{du}{dx} - uv\frac{dw}{dx}}{w^2}\]

						We can substitute to solve for the differential coefficient. Hence,

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{x(\sqrt{1 + x})(\frac{-1}{2\sqrt{1 - x}}) + \sqrt{1 - x}\sqrt{1 + x}(1) - x\sqrt{1 - x}\frac{1}{2\sqrt{1 + x}}}{1 + x}\]

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{-x\sqrt{1 + x}}{2\sqrt{1 - x}} - \frac{x\sqrt{1 - x}}{2\sqrt{1 + x}} + \sqrt{1 - x}\sqrt{1 + x}}{1 + x}\]

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{-2x(1 + x) - 2x(1 - x)}{4\sqrt{1-x}\sqrt{1+x}} + \sqrt{1-x}\sqrt{1+x}}{1+x}\]

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{-x}{\sqrt{1-x}\sqrt{1+x}} + \sqrt{1-x}\sqrt{1+x}}{1+x}\]

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-x + (1-x)(1+x)}{\sqrt{1-x}\sqrt{1+x}} * \frac{1}{1+x}\]

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1-x-x^2}{\sqrt{1-x}(1+x)^{\frac{3}{2}}}\]

						And so we obtain an answer for the differential coefficient. Depending on how you simplified, the answer may look slightly different. (Solving for x = 0.5, should give \(\frac{dy}{dx} = 0.1925\) - in case you want to verify that it is correct.).
						<br><br>
						Finally, we have emerged from the belly of the beast. In my opinion, this is what calculus is all about - taking the first principles with a thorough understanding of infinitesimals, to solve problems that are seemingly unsolvable.
