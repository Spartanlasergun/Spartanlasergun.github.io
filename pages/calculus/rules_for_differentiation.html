					The theoretical conception of the differential coefficient is the foundation of calculus, but there are broader rules for its application in the algebraic sense. These rules are no less theoretical, and they are meant to address the application of calculus to more complex problems invloving multiple variables and combinations of functions. This section will discuss how these things are done with respect to the first principles of calculus.

						There are several elementary rules that serve as guidelines for applying calculus to more complex problems. These are known as the Product Rule, the Quotient Rule, and the Chain Rule. It's important to discuss the implications of these rules beforehand, because while they are a great starting point for a more complex understanding of calculus, they are just blunt instruments shaped by the first principles of calculus. Consequently, they serve little more than to develop one's intuition for algebraic manipulations of problems involving differentials. In this respect, I would advise giving greater consideration to their proofs rather than taking the identities wholesale.

						The Product Rule
					</div>					
				</div>

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="slide_text">
						Starting with the product rule, we will first consider trying to differentiate a function that is a product of two other functions, i.e.
						\[f(x) = f(u) * f(v) \]

						Or more simply,

						\[y = u * v\]

						To differentiate the above function, we can begin by applying the first principles to the problem. That is to say, that an infinitely small increase in \(y\), given by \(\delta y\), results in an infinitely small increase in \(u\) and \(v\), given by \(\delta u\) and \(\delta v\).

						\[y + \delta y = (u + \delta u)(v + \delta v)\]

						Expanding we get:

						\[y + \delta y = uv + u\delta v + v\delta u + \delta u\delta v\]

						Since \(y = uv\)

						\[uv + \delta y = uv + u\delta v + v\delta u + \delta u\delta v\]

						\[\delta y = u\delta v + v\delta u + \delta u\delta v\]

						Recall, that our differential coefficient is the limit of the ratio of infinitely small changes in any two variables. Most typically represented by \(\delta y\) and \(\delta x\) - 

						\[\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}\]

						We divide through by \(\delta x\), so that all parts of the function are changing with respect to the same variable. This gives us:

						\[\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = u\frac{\delta v}{\delta x} + v\frac{\delta u}{\delta x} + \delta u\frac{\delta v}{\delta x}\]

						Since all parts of the function are changing with respect to \(\delta x\), as \(\delta x\) approaches \(0\), \(\delta y\), \(\delta u\), and \(\delta v\) will all approach zero. We can use this information to assess the limit of the function and obtain a unqiue expression for the differential coefficient of products. Assessing the limit:

						\[\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = u\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta v}{\delta x} + v\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta u}{\delta x} + \delta u\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta v}{\delta x}\]

						In the above expression, as \(\delta x \to 0\), \(\delta u \to 0\). Hence,

						\[\delta u\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta v}{\delta x} = 0\]

						The other limits, \(\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}\), \(\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta v}{\delta x}\), and \(\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta u}{\delta x}\) cannot be simplified or assessed without using the identity for the differential coefficient itself. This leaves us with:

						\[\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = u\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta v}{\delta x} + v\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta u}{\delta x}\]

						Or,

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = u\frac{dv}{dx} + v\frac{du}{dx}\]

						We can use the above identity to solve for the differential of any product of functions - especially in cases where the product itself is difficult to simplify. An example is given below.

						<div class="separator"></div>

						<div class="sub_section">
							<div class="sub_section_heading">
								Example
							</div>							
						</div>

						Consider the expression:

						\[(x^2 - 5)(x^2 + 5)\]

						We can apply our product identity to easily solve for the differential. 

						\[let \ \ u = x^2 - 5\]
						
						\[let \ \ v = x^2 + 5\]

						\[\frac{du}{dx} = 2x\]

						\[\frac{dv}{dx} = 2x\]

						Using our identity:

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = u\frac{dv}{dx} + v\frac{du}{dx}\]

						Hence,

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = (x^2 - 5)(2x) + (x^2 + 5)(2x)\]

						Simplifying:

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x^3 - 10x + 2x^3 + 10x\]

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = 4x^3\]

						If thus far, you're not impressed by the product rule, then you're in the right frame of mind. It would have been easy to simply expand the expression in the above example and differentiate each term individually - arguably even easier than applying a complicated identity relating two functions. To understand the value in the product rule, we have to go deeper into the lions den.

						The Quotient Rule
					</div>					
				</div>

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="slide_text">
						The quotient rule is similar to the product rule, but instead of a product, we are considering the derivative of a quotient. Consider the following function:

						\[y = \frac{u}{v}\]

						Now, lets apply our first principles so that we can solve for the differential coefficient.

						\[y + \delta y = \frac{u + \delta u}{v + \delta v}\]

						We know that \(y = \frac{u}{v}\), hence

						\[\frac{u}{v} + \delta y = \frac{u + \delta u}{v + \delta v}\]

						and simplyfying, we get

						\[(\frac{u}{v} + \delta y)(v + \delta v) = u + \delta u \]

						\[u + \frac{u}{v}\delta v + v\delta y + \delta y\delta v = u + \delta u \]

						\[\frac{u}{v}\delta v + v\delta y + \delta y\delta v = \delta u \]

						\[\delta y(v + \delta v) = \delta u - \frac{u}{v}\delta v \]

						\[v\delta y(v + \delta v) = v\delta u - u\delta v\]

						\[v\delta y = \frac{v\delta u - u\delta v}{v + \delta v}\]

						\[\delta y = \frac{v\delta u - u\delta v}{v^2 + v\delta v}\]

						Recall, the differential coefficient if the limit of ratio of infinitely small changes in any two variables. We can divide by \(\delta x\) so that all parts of the function are changing with respect to infinitely small changes given by \(\delta x\). Hence, we will obtain the following expression:

						\[\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = \frac{v\frac{\delta u}{\delta x} - u\frac{\delta v}{\delta x}}{v^2 + v\delta v}\]

						Now we can assess the \(\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\) and obtain the differential coefficient:

						\[\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = \frac{v\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta u}{\delta x} - u\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta v}{\delta x}}{v^2 + v\delta v}\]

						As \(\delta x \to 0\), \(\delta y \to 0\), \(\delta u \to 0\), and \(\delta v \to 0\). Hence, our lone \(\delta v\) in the denominator resolves to \(0\) leaving us with :

						\[\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = \frac{v\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta u}{\delta x} - u\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta v}{\delta x}}{v^2}\]

						Or more succinctly, we have the differential coefficient of a quotient as:

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{v\frac{du}{dx} - u\frac{dv}{dx}}{v^2}\]

						This identity for a quotient can be applied when attempting to different any function of the form \(y = \frac{u}{v}\). An example of this is given below.

						<div class="separator"></div>

						<div class="sub_section">
							<div class="sub_section_heading">
								Example
							</div>							
						</div>

						Consider the function:

						\[y = \frac{x + 1}{x + 2}\]

						There is no easy way to differentiate this through simple algebraic manipulation of the terms. However, we can apply our identity for the differential coefficient of a quotient to solve the problem.

						\[let \ \ u = x + 1\]

						\[let \ \ v = x + 2\]

						We know from our identity that 

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{v\frac{du}{dx} - u\frac{dv}{dx}}{v^2}\]

						Solving for \(\frac{du}{dx}\) and \(\frac{dv}{dx}\):

						\[\frac{du}{dx} = 1\]

						\[\frac{dv}{dx} = 1\]

						Substituting into our identity:

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{(x + 2)(1) - (x + 1)(1)}{(x + 2)^2}\]

						Simplifying:

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{x + 2 - x - 1}{(x + 2)^2}\]

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{(x + 2)^2}\]

						<div class="separator"></div>

						Perhaps now you're a tad more impressed with the quotient rule than the product rule. After all, there was no was to simplify the expression to easily obtain the differential - and the quotient rule served great purpose to that end. However, I advise caution. As stated in the beginning, the quotient rule should be considered no more than a passing fancy in the world of calculus. It's the principle of its derivation that ultimately is of use. Before I can illustrate this, we have one more rule to explore - the chain rule.
