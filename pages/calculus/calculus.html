						The origins of calculus can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where mathematicians and scholars began grappling with problems involving change and motion. Historically, there are many scholars across different countries and races that helped to lay the groundwork for modern calculus as we know it. Much of this was brought together by Issac Newton who is often incorrectly credited as being the sole inventor, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz who also created the common notation for integration and differentiation that we use.

						The Babylonians demonstrated an early form of calculus-like thinking in their understanding and use of numerical approximations. They developed techniques to estimate the values of square roots, cube roots, and trigonometric functions, which involved iterative procedures and successive approximations. These methods bear some resemblance to the iterative processes used in calculus.

						Greek mathematicians, such as Eudoxus and Archimedes, developed the method of exhaustion, which involved approximating areas and volumes by dividing them into smaller parts. This method laid the groundwork for the concept of limits, a fundamental concept in calculus. Additionally, Greek mathematicians contemplated infinitesimals, although not formalized, which stimulated thinking about the nature of infinity and mathematical reasoning.

						Indian mathematicians, such as Madhava and Jyesthadeva, pioneered the concept of infinite series, providing power series expansions for trigonometric functions and deriving early forms of the Taylor series. They refined and extended these series, predating European developments in calculus by several centuries. Additionally, Jyesthadeva introduced differential calculus, developing methods for finding derivatives, while Bhaskara II explored differential calculus in the context of rates of change.

						The approximation methods and integral calculations developed by Arabic mathematicians played a crucial role in the development of calculus. Their iterative processes for approximating square roots, cube roots, and trigonometric values provided valuable insights into the concept of limits and convergence, which are fundamental to calculus. Additionally, Arabic mathematicians like Ibn al-Banna and Ibn al-Haitham made strides in integral calculations, particularly in finding areas and volumes of irregular shapes.

						The development of calculus revolutionized mathematics and paved the way for advancements in physics, engineering, and other scientific disciplines. It provided a powerful tool for understanding and modeling the world around us by enabling precise calculations of rates of change, slopes of curves, areas under curves, and much more. Today, calculus is an essential branch of mathematics with a wide range of applications, from physics and engineering to economics and computer science.
