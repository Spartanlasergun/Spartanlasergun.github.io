					This section is meant to present a comprehensive overview of the application of functions and limits to produce what is commonly understood in calculus as the 'differential coefficent'. In one sense, this is a mathematical proof with a heavy theoretical basis in limits, and in the other can be thought of as a geometric reflection on rates-of-change and gradients, in relation to functions - linear, curved and otherwise. The dilemma in presenting this information is the necessity to conceptualize both of these ideas without taking the underlying theory of these individual concepts for granted. To avoid any issues, it is necessary to begin with an introduction into the conception of the infinitesimal and the nature of change on the infinitesimal scale.

					<div class="slide_text">
						In the previous section on limits, the idea of approaching infinity was introduced. From this, it should be understood that some functions have theoretical limits that cannot be mathematically quantified or expressed without special consideration.
						<br><br>
						In this section it is necessary to expand our theoretical conception of infinity. Instead of considering the limit of a function, or the approach to infinity, I want to consider change on the infinitesimal scale itself. In particular, I want to draw attention to the nature of this change, as it is of the utmost importance to calculus.
						<br><br>
						Imagine that I have some variable \(x\), and some variable \(y\). Consider that these two variables represent an arbitrary point on a cartesian plane. Now consider an infinitely small change in both of these variables represent by \(\delta x\) and \(\delta y\).
						<br><br>
						In what direction has this change taken place? Well, it would be difficult to say left or right, up or down etc. An infinitely small change is so minute, that we can essentially consider that we have not moved from the original point. Moreover, we can make another inference. Since the change is infinitely small, it would be impossible for there to exist a point in between our original position and our infinitesimal change. Hence, the change in position from \( \ \ (x, \ y) \ \ \) to \( \ \ ((x + \delta x), \ (y + \delta y)) \  \ \) would necessarily occur in a straight line. The consideration that this change will always occur in a straight line is extremely important. In mathematically expressing this change, we can also define an expression for the gradient of this line, as the change itself has already been defined. This is the foundation of calculus. The mathematical proof of the relationship between this infinitesimal change and the gradient of a straight line is given below.
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="slide_text">
						Consider the graph on the right. As a straight line graph we know that it would be defined by some function of the form:

						\[y = mx + c\]

						We also know that the gradient of this line is the ratio of change in \(y\) and \(x\). Hence:

						\[m = \frac{change \ in \ y}{change \ in \ x} \]

						\[m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\]

						\[m = \frac{\delta y}{\delta x}\]

						<img src="../../images/uniform_motion.png" alt="uniform motion">
					</div>					
				</div>

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="slide_text">
						Taking our original function, \( \ y = mx + c \ \ \) we can define our gradient in terms of this infinitesimal change. This is illustrated below:
						
						\[y = mx + c\]

						\[y + \delta y = m(x + \delta x) + c\]

						Hence,

						\[mx + c + \delta y = mx + m\delta x + c\]

						\[\delta y = mx + m\delta x\]

						\[\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = \frac{mx}{\delta x} + m\]

						Recall, we are considering an infinitesimal change. This means that we need to consider the limits of this function.

						\[\lim_{\delta x \to \infty} \frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = m\]

						If you have followed the theoretical explanation along with the math up to this point, it may seem a bit odd that we have represented the gradient in such a way. In fact, it may seem as though the changes on an infintesimal scale represents genuine quantifiable change, without consequence, - which it does. This is a bit difficult to conceptualize, and as such I would suggest that this change should be thought of in the light of natural law. It is complex enough that it cannot easily be understood or conceptualized, but indeed it does represent something fundamental and natural as it concerns the nature of change.

					<div class="slide_text">
						Of course, deriving the gradient of a straight line in such a way has little to no value. The practical value of this understanding comes when it is applied to curved functions. This is another difficult idea to conceptualize. Do curved lines have a gradient? Yes, they do. Rather, the gradient of a curved line is constantly changing and is different from place to place - hence, it is represented by a function rather that a static value. In the same way that we have derived the gradient for the linear function based on an infinitesimal change, we can now derive a function of the gradient for a curved line.

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="slide_text">
						Lets consider the curve defined by 

						\[y = x^2\] 

						Again lets take a point on this curve - 

						\[(x, \ y)\] 

						- and lets consider an infinitesimal change from this point represented by 

						\[(x + \delta x), \ (y + \delta y)\]

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="slide_text">
						We understand theoretically from the nature of this change, that it is too small to be considered different from the position \((x, \ y)\), and it will necessarily occur in a straight line. Hence, if we find the gradient associated with this change, we will find the gradient of the curve at that point. Consequently, it will also represent the gradient of a straight line that is tangential to the curve at that point.

						Defining the Gradient

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="slide_text">
						The problem in attempting to address the idea of gradient as it is relevant to curves, is that while the algebraic and theoretical reasoning for the gradient of a straight line is simple and foundational, the theoretical basis for the gradient function of a curve is different enough that it can be considered a problem in its own right.
						<br><br>
						Nevertheless, we will begin with a reflection on the function of a straight line.

						\[y = mx + c\]

						Above is the basic function of a straight line. We can simplify this much further by taking the function of a straight line that passes through the origin. In which case the y-intercept is \(0\) and the resulting function is given by:

						\[y = mx\]

						Now we can represent this function solely in terms of the gradient, where

						\[m = \frac{y}{x}\]

						\[m = \frac{change \ in \ y}{change \ in \ x} \]
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="slide_text">
						The graph on the right illustrates uniform motion of an object with respect to time. We can take two points from this graph to solve for the gradient:

						\[(0, 0) \ \ and \ \ (2, 2)\]

						The gradient then is given by:

						\[\frac{change \ in \ y}{change \ in \ x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{2 - 0}{2 - 0}\]

						hence,
						\[m = 1\]

						The idea of change can also be easily demonstrated using popular mechanics.
					</div>
					<div class="slide_img_left">
						<img src="../../images/uniform_motion.png" alt="uniform motion">
					</div>					
				</div>

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="slide_text">
						In mechanics, velocity(\(v\)) of an object is defined as the change in distance(\(s\)) travelled with respect to time(\(t\)):

						\[v = \frac{change \ in \ distance}{change \ in \ time} = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}\]

						Hence,

						\[v =  \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{2 - 0}{2 - 0} = 1 \ ms^{-1}\]

						Therefore the object is travelling at rate of \(1 \ ms^{-1}\), which represents a change in distance of one meter every second.
						<br><br>
						In calculus we are intimately concerned with the idea of inifinity. When we talk about change in calculus, we are concerned with the smallest possible changes that can be mathematically represented.
						<br><br>
						With some algebraic reasoning, let us take \(\delta y\) as representing the smallest possible change in \(y\), and \(\delta x\) as representing the smallest possible change in the value of \(x\).
						<br><br>
						Our original equation of \(y = mx\) becomes:

						\[y + \delta y = m(x + \delta x)\]

						hence,

						\[y + \delta y = mx + m\delta x\]

						since \(y = mx\),

						\[mx + \delta y = mx + \delta x\]

						\[\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = m\]

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="slide_text">
						<br><br>
						So we have now put to rest the relationship between change and the gradient. When this change is non-linear, as in the case of a curve, the problem is much more complex and invovles the theoretical application of limits.
						<br><br>
						We have in a previous section, studied limits in relation to the graph of \(y = \frac{1}{x}\). It makes sense to revisit this problem, but with a focus on understanding the relationship between limits and the gradient of curved lines.
					</div>
					<div class="slide_img_left">

				<div class="slide_box">
					<div class="slide_text">
						So, how do we theoretically apply an understanding of limits to find the gradient at any point on the curve. Well in theory, the gradient at any point on a curve can be represented by a straight line through that point that is tangential to the curve. Infinitely small changes in \(x\) and \(y\) values are theoretically small enough that they will necessarily represent change in a straight line.
						<br><br>
						Therefore, we must form some conception of a function that can generally represent an infinitely small change in values of \(y\) and \(x\) for our curve function, and attempt to determine the ratio of these changes. If we can represent the curve function as a ratio of these changes, we can find the limit of this function, and in turn it will yield a function that represents the gradient of the curve itself.
						<br><br>
						We already understand from studying functions that the symbol \(\delta\) is used to represent change in a variable:
						<br><br>
						We have our curve function \(y = \frac{1}{x}\)
						<br>
						Let \(\delta y =\) the smallest possible change in the function \(y\)
						<br>
						Let \(\delta x =\) the smallest possible change in the variable \(x\)
						<br>
						Therefore, the gradient will be given by: \(\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}\)
						<br>
						Solving for \(\lim_{\delta x \to \infty}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}\)
						\[y = f(x)\]

						\[y = \frac{1}{x}\]

						\[y + \delta y = \frac{1}{x + \delta x}\]

						\[(y + \delta y)(x + \delta x) = 1\]

						Since \(y = \frac{1}{x}\):

						\[(\frac{1}{x} + \delta y)(x + \delta x) = 1\]

						Expanding:

						\[1 + \frac{\delta x}{x} + x(\delta y) + (\delta y)(\delta x) = 1 \]

						Reducing:

						\[\frac{\delta x}{x} + x(\delta y) + (\delta y)(\delta x) = 0\]

						Multiplying by \(x\):

						\[\delta x + x^2(\delta y) + x(\delta y)(\delta x) = 0\]

						We are solving for the limit of the function given by \(\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}\), hence we manipulate the terms:

						\[\delta x + x(\delta y)(\delta x) = -x^2(\delta y)\]

						Multiplying by \(\frac{1}{\delta y}\):

						\[\frac{\delta x}{\delta y} + x(\delta x) = -x^2 \]

						\[\frac{\delta x}{\delta y} = -x^2 - x(\delta x)\]

						Inverting:

						\[\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = \frac{-1}{x^2} - \frac{1}{x(\delta x)}\]

						\[\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = \frac{-1}{x^2} - \lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{1}{x(\delta x)}\]

						\[\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = \frac{-1}{x^2} - 0\]

						\[\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = \frac{-1}{x^2}\]

						or

						\[\lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = -x^{-2}\]

						In mathematics, we say that the limit is called the differential coefficient with respect to \(x\), the independent variable. Hence, for the function \(y = \frac{1}{x}\),

						\[\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = -x^{-2}\]

						Therefore we say that the differential coefficient is \(-x^{-2}\)
