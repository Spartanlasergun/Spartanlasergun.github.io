					This section is meant to present a comprehensive overview of the application of functions and limits to produce what is commonly understood in calculus as the 'differential coefficent'. In one sense, this is a mathematical proof with a heavy theoretical basis in limits, and in the other can be thought of as a geometric reflection on rates of change and gradients, in relation to functions - linear, curved and otherwise. The dilemma in presenting this information is the necessity to conceptualize both of these ideas without asking the reader to take anything for granted. To do this, the previous section on limits must be the first thing that we consider, and so it is at this point that I choose to begin this section.

						In the previous section we discussed limits in relation to the graph of \(y = \frac{1}{x}\). We revisit this problem, but with a focus on understanding the relationship between limits and the gradient.
						<br><br>
						Straight lines possess a gradient that is constant regardless of the changes in \(x\) and \(y\), - precisely because any change in \(x\) in relation to \(y\) is always uniform.
						<br><br>
						With a curved line the problem of gradient becomes more complex.

						In fact, because the changes in \(x\) in relation to \(y\) is non-uniform, it needs to be represented by its own function. This function and its exact nature we will discuss later, for now we need to revisit the limits of our graph above. In particular, I want to explore
						\[\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{1}{x} = 0\]
						and 
						\[\lim_{x \to 1}\frac{1}{x} = 1\]
						These two limits of our function are interesting. We can observe that as \(x\) approaches \(\infty\) (\(\lim_{x \to \infty}\)) we would be looking at a straight horizontal line whose gradient would be equal to \(0\). Did finding the limit produce the gradient at this point?
						<br><br>
						Alternatively, we can observe that as \(x\) approaches \(1\) (\(\lim_{x \to 1}\)) we would be looking at a straight vertical line whose gradient would be equal to \(1\). Did finding the limit produce the gradient of our curve at that point?
						<br><br>
						No. We did not find the gradient at that point. What we found was a solution to the function of the curve at that point. The approach of \(x\) to \(\infty\), or the value \(1\), is conceived of by the smallest possible increment to that value. So small, that it is necessarily uniform and represents also the solution to the function of a straight line through that point - in this case, the line coincedentally being horizontal, or vertical and easily recognizable by gradients of \(0\) and \(1\). 
						<br><br>
						The question becomes, how do we theoretically apply this understanding to find the gradient at any point on the curve that can be represented by a straight line through that point? The answer is, that we must form some conception of a function that can generally represent an infinitly small change in values of \(y\) and \(x\) for our function, and apply our understanding of limits to it.
