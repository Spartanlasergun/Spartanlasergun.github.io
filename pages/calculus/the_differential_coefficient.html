					This section is meant to present a comprehensive overview of the application of functions and limits to produce what is commonly understood in calculus as the 'differential coefficent'. In one sense, this is a mathematical proof with a heavy theoretical basis in limits, and in the other can be thought of as a geometric reflection on rates-of-change and gradients, in relation to functions - linear, curved and otherwise. The dilemma in presenting this information is the necessity to conceptualize both of these ideas without taking the underlying theory of these individual concepts for granted. Further trouble arises wherein it becomes impossible to speak about gradients in relation to a curve without precluding an understanding of calculus itself.

						The problem in attempting to address the idea of gradient as it is relevant to curves, is that while the algebraic and theoretical reasoning for the gradient of a straight line is simple and foundational, the theoretical basis for the gradient function of a curve is different enough that it can be considered a problem in its own right.
						<br><br>
						Nevertheless, we will begin with a reflection on the function of a straight line.

						\[y = mx + c\]

						Above is the basic function of a straight line. We can simplify this much further by taking the function of a straight line that passes through the origin. In which case the y-intercept is \(0\) and the resulting function is given by:

						\[y = mx\]

						Now we can represent this function solely in terms of the gradient, where

						\[m = \frac{y}{x}\]

						In which case, the gradient is represented by a ratio of the change in \(\frac{y}{x}\). Our algebraic reasoning stops here, but our theoretical understanding can extend our conception of gradients a little bit. This theoretical conception that should not be misunderstood, is that our gradient is actually representing change in the function of \(x\), over change in the variable of \(x\). i.e.

						\[y = f(x)\]

						hence,

						\[m = \frac{f(x)}{x}\]

						\[m = \frac{change \ in \ the \ function \ of \ x}{change \ in \ the \ variable \ of \ x} = \frac{change \ in \ y}{change \ in \ x} \]

						In the previous section we discussed limits in relation to the graph of \(y = \frac{1}{x}\). We revisit this problem, but with a focus on understanding the relationship between limits and the gradient.
						<br><br>
						Straight lines possess a gradient that is constant regardless of the changes in \(x\) and \(y\), - precisely because any change in \(x\) in relation to \(y\) is always uniform.

						In fact, because the changes in \(x\) in relation to \(y\) is non-uniform, it needs to be represented by its own function. This function and its exact nature we will discuss later, for now we need to revisit the limits of our graph above. In particular, I want to explore
						\[\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{1}{x} = 0\]
						and 
						\[\lim_{x \to 1}\frac{1}{x} = 1\]
						These two limits of our function are interesting. We can observe that as \(x\) approaches \(\infty\) (\(\lim_{x \to \infty}\)) we would be looking at a straight horizontal line whose gradient would be equal to \(0\). Did finding the limit produce the gradient at this point?
						<br><br>
						Alternatively, we can observe that as \(x\) approaches \(1\) (\(\lim_{x \to 1}\)) we would be looking at a straight vertical line whose gradient would be equal to \(1\). Did finding the limit produce the gradient of our curve at that point?
						<br><br>
						No. We did not find the gradient at that point as gradient is ratio of change in \(y\) and \(x\). What we found was a solution to the function of the curve at that point. The approach of \(x\) to \(\infty\), or the value \(1\), is conceived of by the smallest possible increment to that value - so infinitely small, that it is necessarily uniform and represents also the solution to the function of a straight line through that point - in this case, the line coincedentally being horizontal, or vertical and easily recognizable by gradients of \(0\) and \(1\) and solutions of \(0\) and \(1\) for all values of \(x\) or \(y\). 
						<br><br>
						The question becomes, how do we theoretically apply this understanding to find the gradient at any point on the curve that can be represented by a straight line through that point? The answer is, that we must form some conception of a function that can generally represent an infinitely small change in values of \(y\) and \(x\) for our function, and attempt to determine the ratio of these changes. If we can represent the function as a ratio of these changes, we can find the limit of this function, and it will yield a function that represents the gradient of the curve itself.
						<br><br>
						We already understand from studying functions that the symbol \(\delta\) is used to represent change in a variable:
						<br><br>
						We have our curve function \(y = \frac{1}{x}\)
						<br>
						Let \(\delta y =\) the smallest possible change in the function \(y\)
						<br>
						Let \(\delta x =\) the smallest possible change in the variable \(x\)
						<br>
						Therefore, the gradient will be given by: \(\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}\)
						<br>
						Solving for \(\lim_{\delta x \to \infty}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}\)
						\[y = f(x)\]
						\[y = \frac{1}{x}\]
						\[y + \delta y = \frac{1}{x + \delta x}\]
						\[(y + \delta y)(x + \delta x) = 1\]
						Since \(y = \frac{1}{x}\):
						\[(\frac{1}{x} + \delta y)(x + \delta x) = 1\]
						Expanding:
						\[1 + \frac{\delta x}{x} + x(\delta y) + (\delta y)(\delta x) = 1 \]
						Reducing:
						\[\frac{\delta x}{x} + x(\delta y) + (\delta y)(\delta x) = 0\]
						Multiplying by \(x\):
						\[\delta x + x^2(\delta y) + x(\delta y)(\delta x) = 0\]
						We are solving for the limit of the function given by \(\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}\), hence we manipulate the terms:
						\[\delta x + x(\delta y)(\delta x) = -x^2(\delta y)\]
						Multiplying by \(\frac{1}{\delta y}\):
						\[\frac{\delta x}{\delta y} + x(\delta x) = -x^2 \]
						\[\frac{\delta x}{\delta y} = -x^2 - x(\delta x)\]
						Inverting:
						\[\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = \frac{-1}{x^2} - \frac{1}{x(\delta x)}\]
						\[\lim_{\delta x \to \infty}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = \frac{-1}{x^2} - \lim_{\delta x \to \infty}\frac{1}{x(\delta x)}\]
						\[\lim_{\delta x \to \infty}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = \frac{-1}{x^2} - 0\]
						\[\lim_{\delta x \to \infty}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = \frac{-1}{x^2}\]
						or
						\[\lim_{\delta x \to \infty}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} = -x^{-2}\]
