					At this point, it should be well understood that the derivative of a function that represents a curved line, gives us a function that represents its gradient. There are some unique properties of these derivatives that help significantly with the solving real world problems. In this section, we will explore these ideas and look at a few real world examples illustrating its application.

						The above images contain the graphs of \(y = -x^2\) and \(y = x^2\) respectively. As indicated, the graph on the left has a maximum point at \((0, \ 0)\), and the graph on the right has a minimum point at \((0, \ 0)\). At first glance, it is tempting to jump to conclusion that the maximum point is indicative of a maximum \(y\) value, while the minimum point is indicative of a minimum \(y\) value - after all, it seems to make some kind of intuitive sense based solely on the descriptions as 'maximum' and 'minimum'. However, when we speak about the maximum and minimum points on a curve, we are referring to changes in the sign of the gradient at certain points on the graph.
						<br>
						<br>
						In general, if you were to investigate the changes in the sign of the gradient for the above curves, you would find that at the point \((0, \ 0)\), the gradient changes from positive to negative, or negative to positve - vice versa.
						<br>
						<br>
						More specifically we can characterize the graph as having a maximum or a minimum point based on the following criteria:
						<br>
						<br>
						For the maximum point,
						<ul>
							<li>
								the gradient is positive before the maximum point
							</li>
							<li>
								the gradient is negative after the maximum point
							</li>
							<li>
								the maximum point occurs at \(\frac{dy}{dx} = 0\)
							</li>
						</ul>
						For the minimum point,
						<ul>
							<li>
								the gradient is negative before the minimum point
							</li>
							<li>
								the gradient is positive after the minimum point
							</li>
							<li>
								the minimum point occurs at \(\frac{dy}{dx} = 0\)
							</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="separator"></div>

						Using this information we can determine whether any aribtrary function has a maximum point, and we can also determine the exact coordinates of that point. We know that at the maximum point, the gradient will be equal to \(0\). Taking the derivative of our function,

						\[y = -x^2\]

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = -2x\]

						at \(\frac{dy}{dx} = 0\),

						\[-2x = 0\]

						\[x = 0\]

						Substituting into our curve function, 

						\[y = -(0^2)\]

						\[y = 0\]

						Hence, we can see that the maximum point does indeed occur at \(x = 0, \ \ y = 0\).

						Now lets consider some points on the graph that occur before and after the maximum point - \(x = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2\).
						<br>
						Using our funtion, we can solve for the gradient at these points,

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = -2x\]

						\[for \ \ x = -2, \ \ \ y = -(-2^2) = -4, \ \ \frac{dy}{dx} = -2(-2) = 4\]

						\[for \ \ x = -1, \ \ \ y = -(-1^2) = -1, \ \ \frac{dy}{dx} = -2(-1) = 2\]

						\[for \ \ x = 0, \ \ \ y = -(0^2) = 0, \ \ \frac{dy}{dx} = -2(0) = 0\]

						\[for \ \ x = 1, \ \ \ y = -(2^2) = 4, \ \ \frac{dy}{dx} = -2(1) = -2\]

						\[for \ \ x = 2, \ \ \ y = -(1^2) = 1, \ \ \frac{dy}{dx} = -2(2) = -4\]

						Looking at the above values, we can see that before the point \((0, 0)\), the gradient is positive, and after the point \((0, 0)\), the gradient is negative. This means that there is a maximum point at \((0, 0)\). This is important to consider as we can easily distinguish the nature of the graph without having to plot its values. There are even simpler ways to do this, but for now we will move on to an examination of Minimum Points.

						<div class="separator"></div>

						At the minimum point (much like the maximum point), the gradient is equal to \(0\). Using these properties, we can determine exactly where this point occurs, and understand its nature as minimum (or maximum as previously discussed). We can work this out as follows:

						\[y = x^2\]

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x\]

						at \(x = 0\),

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = 2(0)\]

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = 0\]

						\[and \ \ y = (0)^2 = 0\]

						Hence, we can say that the graph has either a minimum or maximum at \(x = 0, \ \ y = 0\). To understand the nature of the point, we can examine the changes in the sign of the gradient as we did earlier. Taking values of \(x\) at \(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\):

						\[for \ \ x = -2, \ \ \ y = (-2^2) = 4, \ \ \frac{dy}{dx} = 2(-2) = -4\]

						\[for \ \ x = -1, \ \ \ y = (-1^2) = 1, \ \ \frac{dy}{dx} = 2(-1) = -2\]

						\[for \ \ x = 0, \ \ \ y = (0^2) = 0, \ \ \frac{dy}{dx} = 2(0) = 0\]

						\[for \ \ x = 1, \ \ \ y = (1^2) = 1, \ \ \frac{dy}{dx} = 2(1) = 2\]

						\[for \ \ x = 2, \ \ \ y = (2^2) = 4, \ \ \frac{dy}{dx} = 2(2) = 4\]

						Looking at the above values, we can see that before the point \((0, 0)\), the sign of the gradient is negative, and after the point \((0, 0)\), the sign of the gradient is positive. This meanse that the graph has a minimum point at \(x = 0, \ \ y = 0\).
						<br>
						<br>
						The properties of Maximum and Minimum points are hardly intuitive, and this is seen in the exhaustive method that is used to determine there nature. Fortunately, there is a simpler way to determine the nature of a turning point as a Maximum or Minimum, but it is equally as unintutitve as previous method. We will explore this further in the next section on Inflexion Points.

						The Inflexion Point, is the mathematical way of referring to a point on the graph where the sign of the differential itself is neither positive nor negative, i.e. it occurs directly in between a minimum and maximum point. The graph below illustrates this.
