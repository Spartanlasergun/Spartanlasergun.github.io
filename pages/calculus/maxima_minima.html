					At this point, it should be well understood that the derivative of a function that represents a curved line, gives us a function that represents its gradient. There are some unique properties of these derivatives that help significantly with the solving real world problems. In this section, we will explore these ideas and look at a few real world examples illustrating its application.

						The graph on the right illustrates the function \(y = -x^2\). This graph can be described mathematically as having a maximum point at \(x = 0, y = 0\). Looking at changes in the gradient function, there is an interesting property concerning curves that have a maxmimum point. If the \(y\) values decrease as \(x\) increases, the gradient - \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) - is positive, and if \(y\) decreases as \(x\) increases then the gradient - \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) - is negative. At it's maximum, the tangent to the curve will be completely horiztonal, meaning that \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) must be equal to \(0\).

						Using this information we can determine whether any aribtrary function has a maximum point, and we can also determine the exact coordinates of that point. We know that at the maximum point, the gradient will be equal to \(0\). Taking the derivative of our function,

						\[y = -x^2\]

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = -2x\]

						at \(\frac{dy}{dx} = 0\),

						\[-2x = 0\]

						\[x = 0\]

						Substituting into our curve function, 

						\[y = -(0^2)\]

						\[y = 0\]

						Hence, we can see that the maximum point does indeed occur at \(x = 0, \ \ y = 0\).

						Now lets consider the points on the graph at \(x = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2\).
						<br>
						Using our funtion, we can solve for the gradient at these points,

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = -2x\]

						at \(x = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2\),

						\[for \ \ x = -2, \ \ \ y = -(-2^2) = -4, \ \ \frac{dy}{dx} = -2(-2) = 4\]

						\[for \ \ x = -1, \ \ \ y = -(-1^2) = -1, \ \ \frac{dy}{dx} = -2(-1) = 2\]

						\[for \ \ x = 0, \ \ \ y = -(0^2) = 0, \ \ \frac{dy}{dx} = -2(0) = 0\]

						\[for \ \ x = 1, \ \ \ y = -(2^2) = 4, \ \ \frac{dy}{dx} = -2(1) = -2\]

						\[for \ \ x = 2, \ \ \ y = -(1^2) = 1, \ \ \frac{dy}{dx} = -2(2) = -4\]

						Looking at the above values, we can see that as \(x\) increases and \(y\) increases, the gradient is positive, and as \(x\) increases and \(y\) decreases, the gradient is negative. This is an important point, as we will see that not all graphs have a maximum point, and we can distinguish the nature of the graph without having to plot its values through some simple calculations as is shown above. There are even simpler ways to do this, but for now we will move on to an examination of Minimum Points.

						The graph on the left illustrates the function \(y = x^2\), which contrary to the previous graph, has a minimum point at \(x = 0, \ \ y = 0\). Similarly to curves with a maximum value, curves with a minimum value also have unique properties with respect to changes in the sign of the gradient as the graph approaches its minimum and leaves. Sepcifically, as values of \(x\) increase and values of \(y\) decrease, the gradient \((\frac{dy}{dx})\) is negative, and as values of \(x\) increase and values of \(y\) increase, the gradient is positive.

						At the minimum point (much like the maximum point), the gradient is equal to \(0\). Using these properties, we can determine exactly where this point occurs, and understand its nature as minimum (or maximum as previously discussed). We can work this out as follows:

						\[y = x^2\]

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x\]

						at \(x = 0\),

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = 2(0)\]

						\[\frac{dy}{dx} = 0\]

						\[and \ \ y = (0)^2 = 0\]

						Hence, we can say that the graph has either a minimum or maximum at \(x = 0, \ \ y = 0\). To understand the nature of the point, we can examine the changes in the sign of the gradient as we did earlier. Taking values of \(x\) at \(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\):

						\[for \ \ x = -2, \ \ \ y = (-2^2) = 4, \ \ \frac{dy}{dx} = 2(-2) = -4\]

						\[for \ \ x = -1, \ \ \ y = (-1^2) = 1, \ \ \frac{dy}{dx} = 2(-1) = -2\]

						\[for \ \ x = 0, \ \ \ y = (0^2) = 0, \ \ \frac{dy}{dx} = 2(0) = 0\]

						\[for \ \ x = 1, \ \ \ y = (1^2) = 1, \ \ \frac{dy}{dx} = 2(1) = 2\]

						\[for \ \ x = 2, \ \ \ y = (2^2) = 4, \ \ \frac{dy}{dx} = 2(2) = 4\]

						Looking at the above values, we can see that as \(x\) increases and \(y\) decreases, the sign of the gradient is negative, and as \(x\) increases and \(y\) increases, the sign of the gradient is positive. This meanse that the graph has a minimum point at \(x = 0, \ \ y = 0\).
						<br>
						The properties of Maximum and Minimum points are hardly intuitive, and this is seen in the exhaustive method that is used to determine there nature. Fortunately, there is a simpler way to determine the nature of a turning point as a Maximum or Minimum that arises from our understanding of how the sign of the gradient changes at these points on the graph. We will explore this in the next section.

						The Inflexion Point, is the mathematical way of referring to a point on the graph where the sign of the differential itself is neither positive nor negative, i.e. it occurs directly in between a minimum and maximum point. The graph below illustrates this.
