					As a student, I learnt math in the way that I imagine most people do - through practice and repetition. The problem with this approach is that all of the potential utility of math to the real world is lost in favour of being able to quickly apply logical mathematical procedures (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, algebra etc.) to problems that have no theoretical foundation beyond the pages that they are written on.

					Later on in life, when I entered the field of psychology, I though about how to fix this problem. More poignantly, I wondered (as most students would), if I would ever find use for the endless calculus and trigonometery problems that plagued my life for most of high-school. This website is my humble attempt to fix that.

					Here lies a collection of notes and thoughts about various mathematical concepts that are all structured around the idea that understanding the principles behind each concept is more valuable than being able to ignorantly apply them to solve a problem. Once these principles are laid out to my satisfaction, their practical application is discussed in a real world context. Consequently, a list of real-world endeavours (rather than a list of math problems) is also given. Enjoy!
