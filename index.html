					As a student, I learnt math in the way that I imagine most people do - through practice and repetition. The great tragedy of this approach, was that all of the utility of math to the real world was lost in favour of being able to quickly apply logical mathematical procedures (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, algebra etc.) to problems that have no theoretical foundation beyond the pages that they are written on.

				<div class="para_two">
					Later on in life, when I entered the field of psychology, I thought about how to fix this problem. More poignantly, I wondered (as most students would), if I would ever find use for the endless calculus and trigonometery problems that I was forced to learn in high-school. This website is my humble attempt to fix that.

				<div class="para_three">
					Here lies a collection of notes and thoughts that are carefully built around the idea that understanding the principles behind a mathematical concept is more valuable than being able to ignorantly apply a formula or procedure to solve a problem. These principles are first laid out to my own satisfaction, and following this, their practical application is discussed in a real world context. Consequently, I have attempted to give a list of real-world endeavours (rather than a list of math problems) at the end of each section. Enjoy!
